        <p>They're not really into it, and like,</p>
      
        <p>I could kill right away.</p>
      
        <p>Like,</p>
      
        <p>can I give you an example?</p>
      
        <p>I have a bad eyesight,</p>
      
        <p>except for these situations.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>One time, we were watching TV, right,</p>
      
        <p>with me and my friends. We had a commercial on.</p>
      
        <p>It's one of those dumb commercials where everybody's</p>
      
        <p>exercising or whatever, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I'm like, wow, did you see that?</p>
      
        <p>And they're like, what? They didn't see it.</p>
      
        <p>So you know those exercises where the girl lays flat,</p>
      
        <p>they raise their leg? Well, this one,</p>
      
        <p>they have a panty on, so as soon as she raise one</p>
      
        <p>leg, you can see one and a half lips.</p>
      
        <p>And like, I caught it.</p>
      
        <p>It's not like I'm not even there for like, not even like a second.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I caught it, right?</p>
      
        <p>Right? I can't play baseball, basketball,</p>
      
        <p>I don't have any, but</p>
      
        <p>stuff like that, I'm really good at catching.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really good at catching it for some reason.</p>
      
        <p>Like, there...</p>
      
        <p>This is how good I was.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>It's like an icon.</p>
      
        <p>Imagine a recognition.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, that's... I mean, if you were to show me a guy from</p>
      
        <p>2012 or earlier,</p>
      
        <p>I could usually tell</p>
      
        <p>whose dick that was.</p>
      
        <p>You know, because I've seen it so many times.</p>
      
        <p>Like, Eric Everhart, always bent to the left</p>
      
        <p>hand side, and you know, other ones that</p>
      
        <p>look like a triangle dick on top.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, you know, you just... I've seen it so many times,</p>
      
        <p>I don't remember, but, um,</p>
      
        <p>one time, this transgender</p>
      
        <p>girl,</p>
      
        <p>she used fake ID</p>
      
        <p>to work. So she had a fake ID that looked like</p>
      
        <p>18. Couple years later,</p>
      
        <p>she started using her real ID,</p>
      
        <p>and she was like,</p>
      
        <p>oh, there's a discrepancy in</p>
      
        <p>birthdays, and of course, nobody noticed it.</p>
      
        <p>Of course, I remember, for some reason,</p>
      
        <p>I remember, like, I caught that kind of stuff.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, I was like, I don't know,</p>
      
        <p>I mean, we all have something we are good at,</p>
      
        <p>and that's what I was good at.</p>
      
        <p>I can't put IKEA shit together,</p>
      
        <p>but I could tell you, like,</p>
      
        <p>which tranny from which scene...</p>
      
        <p>It would be interesting if you had, like,</p>
      
        <p>a guidance counselor at school</p>
      
        <p>that was like, Yoshi, what do you grow up with?</p>
      
        <p>What do you want to be? I want to see vagina.</p>
