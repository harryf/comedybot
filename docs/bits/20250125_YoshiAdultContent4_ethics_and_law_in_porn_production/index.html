        <p>so, I cannot</p>
      
        <p>okay this, right? So, I don't</p>
      
        <p>know what to do, so I call my colleague,</p>
      
        <p>seven of them, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, there's seven grown men</p>
      
        <p>standing in front of the TV,</p>
      
        <p>and, you know, I'm doing forward,</p>
      
        <p>reverse, forward, so like,</p>
      
        <p>this liquid's going out,</p>
      
        <p>in the asshole, out,</p>
      
        <p>in the asshole, go, go, go, go, go, go,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da,</p>
      
        <p>da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, right?</p>
      
        <p>And then we look, like,</p>
      
        <p>four people say, yay,</p>
      
        <p>four people say, nay, so like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, it's like</p>
      
        <p>Supreme Court decision, so we have to</p>
      
        <p>call our general manager, Chris, again,</p>
      
        <p>Mr. Thumb,</p>
      
        <p>and I don't know why,</p>
      
        <p>he can't stand, look, he had to stand</p>
      
        <p>like this, kinda look at me,</p>
      
        <p>look at that, you know, like that,</p>
      
        <p>and he goes,</p>
      
        <p>leave it, that's fine,</p>
      
        <p>right, so,</p>
      
        <p>that's my life with evil angel, nine years,</p>
      
        <p>right, like,</p>
      
        <p>and, um, and,</p>
      
        <p>my, my expertise</p>
      
        <p>was transgender porn,</p>
      
        <p>and,</p>
      
        <p>here's the thing, ladies, if you show me</p>
      
        <p>dicks, like,</p>
      
        <p>2012 and earlier,</p>
      
        <p>95%</p>
      
        <p>probability that I</p>
      
        <p>know whose dick that is, if you show me</p>
      
        <p>dicks, I'm gonna beat you guys</p>
      
        <p>down.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, you know,</p>
      
        <p>assholes, about 80%, you know what I mean,</p>
      
        <p>like, uh,</p>
      
        <p>right, so,</p>
      
        <p>and that's why I ended up doing transgender porn,</p>
      
        <p>because, here's the problem with transgender porn,</p>
      
        <p>not that, being transgender, but,</p>
      
        <p>these fucking people,</p>
      
        <p>so they would take passport pictures,</p>
      
        <p>looking like a regular guy with no makeup,</p>
      
        <p>but in a movie, they put so much makeup,</p>
      
        <p>I have,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I,</p>
      
        <p>I match the, there's like five or six</p>
      
        <p>scenes with five or six different transgender people,</p>
      
        <p>and I have a five different</p>
      
        <p>paperwork, and a lot of times they film</p>
      
        <p>shit in Brazil, so, already copies</p>
      
        <p>are bad, it's in Portuguese, I don't</p>
      
        <p>read the language,</p>
      
        <p>so I gotta fucking match,</p>
      
        <p>right,</p>
      
        <p>and they pick, so,</p>
      
        <p>I mean, it's like CSI Van Nuys, right,</p>
      
        <p>like, um,</p>
      
        <p>like, sometimes, oh, okay,</p>
      
        <p>this person tattooed, so I could match with that,</p>
      
        <p>tattooed,</p>
      
        <p>right, so, it's like</p>
      
        <p>a lot of fucking puzzle, right,</p>
      
        <p>and, um, so,</p>
      
        <p>I had to do that, and, um,</p>
      
        <p>one time,</p>
      
        <p>I caught it,</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I'm completely useless,</p>
      
        <p>but one time,</p>
      
        <p>I noticed something with ID,</p>
      
        <p>this is how blue my eyes were,</p>
      
        <p>this transgender</p>
      
        <p>person</p>
      
        <p>filmed movies underage, she had a fake ID,</p>
      
        <p>so when she turned 18,</p>
      
        <p>she used her correct ID,</p>
      
        <p>so obviously you have</p>
      
        <p>this person with two different</p>
      
        <p>birthdays, but nobody noticed</p>
      
        <p>it except fucking Mr. Pervert over</p>
      
        <p>here,</p>
      
        <p>because I'm not really good at anything,</p>
      
        <p>um, but,</p>
      
        <p>this is how good my eyes, I don't have a good</p>
      
        <p>eye vision, but when it comes to perverted</p>
      
        <p>things, my eyes are pretty good, um,</p>
      
        <p>one time I was watching a commercial,</p>
      
        <p>they had a commercial, gym commercial,</p>
      
        <p>right, people are exercising,</p>
      
        <p>join this gym now,</p>
      
        <p>you know, 50 Swiss, whatever,</p>
      
        <p>per month, whatever,</p>
      
        <p>and, and, um, I goes,</p>
      
        <p>oh my god, did you see it, my friend, none of them</p>
      
        <p>caught it, so, split second,</p>
      
        <p>when this girl was, you know, I don't know what you call it,</p>
      
        <p>she was laying flat in this</p>
      
        <p>exercise, and you know when she raised one</p>
      
        <p>leg up really high, you know what I'm talking about,</p>
      
        <p>it's one of those leg exercises,</p>
      
        <p>because she wore shorts when she</p>
      
        <p>raised her leg, because</p>
      
        <p>she didn't have panties on, you could see one of the</p>
      
        <p>pussy lips,</p>
      
        <p>and it was like half a second,</p>
      
        <p>and my eye caught it,</p>
      
        <p>I don't have</p>
      
        <p>x-ray vision, well I have triple x-ray</p>
      
        <p>vision, but um,</p>
      
        <p>so,</p>
      
        <p>you know, you guys</p>
      
        <p>are good at programming and do other shit,</p>
      
        <p>so this is what I do, now,</p>
      
        <p>should I keep</p>
      
        <p>going or you guys are still okay?</p>
      
        <p>I'll give it 10 more.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Um,</p>
      
        <p>so I, I think, um,</p>
      
        <p>I think, um,</p>
      
        <p>people ask me, Yoshi, why, why</p>
      
        <p>is it called adult content?</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>I misunderstood.</p>
      
        <p>Um, I, when I was a kid,</p>
      
        <p>when I heard adult content, I thought it meant</p>
      
        <p>adult content,</p>
      
        <p>like adult happiness.</p>
      
        <p>That's what I thought.</p>
      
        <p>And here's the thing,</p>
      
        <p>whether you work in porn shops,</p>
      
        <p>whether it's people that, really,</p>
      
        <p>believe me, if you ended up working</p>
      
        <p>for a guy named Buttman,</p>
      
        <p>you made some</p>
      
        <p>bad decisions in your life, right?</p>
      
        <p>I worked for Buttman.</p>
      
        <p>I worked for Evil Angel.</p>
      
        <p>So when people ask my family,</p>
      
        <p>where does your son work,</p>
      
        <p>you know what my family say?</p>
      
        <p>Since it's called Evil Angel, my family always told everyone,</p>
      
        <p>my son worked for a company called EA.</p>
      
        <p>Which is a video game company</p>
      
        <p>called Electronic Arts, and believe me,</p>
      
        <p>we have joystick, but different kind of</p>
      
        <p>joystick, so anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So they're very embarrassed, I'm not embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>I don't care.</p>
      
        <p>But people who work behind a counter,</p>
      
        <p>customers who buy porn,</p>
      
        <p>people who are performing</p>
      
        <p>front and back,</p>
      
        <p>I gotta tell you,</p>
      
        <p>it has nothing to do with perversity,</p>
      
        <p>in my opinion.</p>
      
        <p>I think a lot of people are just fucking lonely.</p>
      
        <p>Like anybody who works in porn,</p>
      
        <p>believe me, there's not too many people</p>
      
        <p>who fuck in front of camera,</p>
      
        <p>come from really, really close knit family.</p>
      
        <p>Maybe Europeans,</p>
      
        <p>because you guys are not that rich.</p>
      
        <p>You guys are not that religious,</p>
      
        <p>there's no shame, but for Americans</p>
      
        <p>who do porn, there's a lot of shame.</p>
      
        <p>So you really have to cross</p>
      
        <p>the line to put yourself like</p>
      
        <p>an outsider. But in Europe, like,</p>
      
        <p>Rocco Cervetti, Nacho Vidal,</p>
      
        <p>who I also work,</p>
      
        <p>Manuel Ferreira from France,</p>
      
        <p>all these people, there's no shame in Europe,</p>
      
        <p>really, you know, like, because</p>
      
        <p>Americans, Americans</p>
      
        <p>love violence over sex.</p>
      
        <p>You guys like sex over violence,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean? So,</p>
      
        <p>if you're doing porn, you probably came from</p>
      
        <p>a very difficult situation, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, my mom said she wanted</p>
      
        <p>to kill herself every time she sees me.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, she laughed when she</p>
      
        <p>was like, dick. Alright, so,</p>
      
        <p>so I think</p>
      
        <p>I got fired</p>
      
        <p>from a job 2012,</p>
      
        <p>and I've been traveling</p>
      
        <p>the last 12 years</p>
      
        <p>all over the world, relating to</p>
      
        <p>anything related to sex.</p>
      
        <p>Like, when I went to Afghanistan,</p>
      
        <p>three times, on the first day, I found</p>
      
        <p>right away, you could find</p>
      
        <p>prostitutes in Afghanistan, did you know that?</p>
      
        <p>I found it right away within</p>
