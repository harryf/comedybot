        <p>I have to deal with, but, um... So, prior to that, I was working at Taboo Video Store</p>
      
        <p>in downtown LA, you know, and, um... Oh, God, this is a rough one. All right.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>You know how you go to Apple Store, you have a genius bar? So, when you go to Taboo Video</p>
      
        <p>Store, you have a pervert bar. So, I'm the in-house pervert, right? So, I'm there to</p>
      
        <p>help any, you know, people with the problems. And I have to be delicate. I have to be very,</p>
      
        <p>very delicate, you know, because there's some things even you don't want to talk to</p>
      
        <p>a therapist about, you know. And, um... So, here, a couple of stories. I don't... And,</p>
      
        <p>by the way, thank you very much. You paid your... I know you're working really hard</p>
      
        <p>and you spent a valuable time. So, I appreciate it. And, um... I hope I'm not grossing out</p>
      
        <p>with God, but, you know, a couple more then, I'll... God, I feel like this is like a hostage</p>
      
        <p>situation. Anyway...</p>
      
        <p>So, I remember the guy walk in, right? And, um... It's like, oh, I'm a pervert. I'm a</p>
      
        <p>pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert.</p>
      
        <p>It's like one in the morning in Seattle. There's so much snow, I think, like, oh, my God. I'm</p>
      
        <p>working midnight until like the 9 AM shift. And, like, I know what's gonna come. And I</p>
      
        <p>think 2 AM, this gentleman walked in. Just good looking guy. Really well dressed. And,</p>
      
        <p>um... Not a typical customer at a porn store, like, in the late 90s. He went in. I said,</p>
      
        <p>hello, how are you? Quiet. Um... So, I thought, oh, maybe he's shy. No, I can't force it.</p>
      
        <p>Just leave him alone, you know. He checked out the movie section. And after a while...</p>
      
        <p>He got a new song.</p>
      
        <p>Oh!</p>
      
        <p>No, he probably had, like, his assistant pick it up or something, you know. But, um,</p>
      
        <p>he's such a scumbag. Um... I hate that guy. No, no, seriously. Look, fire happened in</p>
      
        <p>California. But a lot to do with resource mismanagement, allocation problem, things</p>
      
        <p>like that. So, people losing their shit. So, yeah, I'm gonna punch that fucker in the face.</p>
      
        <p>Um, I hate him. And I don't think... I'll go back to this one. But, you know, this powerful</p>
      
        <p>motherfucker.</p>
      
        <p>And, um... Did you watch the recent Joe Rogan episode? He finally interviewed an alien.</p>
      
        <p>Well, I call him an alien, but you might call him Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
      
        <p>He's a fucking elite. You know, they're fucking scumbags. And, um...</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my god.</p>
      
        <p>Because I'm... I'm here until next week because I'm going to the World Economic Forum. And,</p>
      
        <p>uh, I'll go back to the show. But I'm really fascinated because I think these powerful</p>
      
        <p>people hurting good regular people.</p>
      
        <p>And, uh, I think it's a lot to do with they have a terrible fantasy and sexual problems.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like... I mean, why... I'm trying to be delicate, but why rape one person when</p>
      
        <p>you could fire 10,000 people for your company? That's how they get off on it.</p>
      
        <p>Because when super rich people don't have a satisfying sex life, they fuck the poor.</p>
      
        <p>Believe me. This is true in UK and America, right? So, that's why I'm kind of obsessed</p>
      
        <p>with the kind of these, um, all these sex stories.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you, sir.</p>
      
        <p>Now, you know what I mean. In the, um...</p>
      
        <p>No, I don't mean it like that.</p>
      
        <p>I'm an ethical pervert. And I mean, it takes one to know one, right? So, um...</p>
      
        <p>I live in LA. I've met a lot of, like, sex workers. Through them, I meet all kinds of</p>
      
        <p>politicians doing all kinds of weird shit. Billionaires and people like that. Believe</p>
      
        <p>me. Um, you know, they're real motherfuckers.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>So, this guy come in. He said, he finally said, hey, could you help me find a movie?</p>
      
        <p>Of course. That's my job. So, I asked him, do you have the porn star's name? Um, do you</p>
      
        <p>have the fetish, company? And everybody says no. So, I tell him, sir, you know, we have</p>
      
        <p>about 11,000 titles. I don't know how to help you. He said, well, you gotta help me find</p>
      
        <p>my daughter.</p>
      
        <p>So, yeah. I kind of laughed, too. Because I, I, this is honest. I thought, okay, he</p>
      
        <p>heard he started doing porn. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew.</p>
      
        <p>And I was like, well, he's a pro. And he's a pro. And he's a pro at doing porn.</p>
      
        <p>He needs evidence to kind of confront her. That's what I thought, right? Boy, I wish</p>
      
        <p>that was the case. You know what happened? His daughter died in a car accident six months</p>
      
        <p>before.</p>
      
        <p>Oh.</p>
      
        <p>And about 11 month, maybe a year before, when she was in college, Girls' Night, they</p>
      
        <p>went to a local strip club. I don't know if you do that in London, but this is kind of</p>
      
        <p>common in America. Like, young girls, Girls' Night, they go to a strip club, have a fun</p>
      
        <p>time. And they just happened to be filming a porn movie in there. And she just happened</p>
      
        <p>to be the audience member.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And she just happened to be, um, a porn star.</p>
      
        <p>Uh-huh.</p>
      
        <p>in there and she just happened to be the audience member.</p>
      
        <p>And this is like his daughter's last live footage.</p>
      
        <p>So he's visiting from Canada, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I mean, I'm a pervert, but I'm not a monster.</p>
      
        <p>I want to help him find it.</p>
      
        <p>But let's be honest, I don't have the title,</p>
      
        <p>nothing like that.</p>
      
        <p>And just like, even if you have it,</p>
      
        <p>there's fucking 11,000 titles.</p>
      
        <p>I only have another five hours to find the goddamn thing.</p>
      
        <p>But I want to help the guy, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So I'm making educated guess, taking all the movie,</p>
      
        <p>going fast forward, you know, like if you have a three VCR,</p>
      
        <p>I'm going fast forward, but it's just three at a time.</p>
      
        <p>And every time customer coming and they're buying butt plug,</p>
      
        <p>I have to stop, get the cash back.</p>
      
        <p>I'm panicking because I'm not finding, you know,</p>
      
        <p>assuming we have him, I'm gonna help this guy.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what to do.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm panicking.</p>
      
        <p>So I find it at 16.</p>
      
        <p>At 6 a.m. I call one of the number one customer shopping,</p>
      
        <p>you know, Glenn.</p>
      
        <p>I call him like a perverted Yoda.</p>
      
        <p>And I call them and I said, here's, so he's very upset</p>
      
        <p>because he told his wife, a fucking liar,</p>
      
        <p>that he doesn't watch porno anymore.</p>
      
        <p>He, Glenn, watch a lot of porn, right?</p>
      
        <p>So he was mad at me, but last second,</p>
      
        <p>I told him what happened, what's going on.</p>
      
        <p>So he understood, like he has a daughter too.</p>
      
        <p>So he said, did you check this ABCD section?</p>
      
        <p>Like, yeah, I'm not an idiot.</p>
      
        <p>And he finally said, did you check the gay and bisexual section?</p>
      
        <p>I said, Glenn, I'm looking for a heterosexual girl.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, you don't understand, many of the strippers,</p>
      
        <p>gay men dancing for women.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know that was pretty new at that business at the time.</p>
      
        <p>So, okay, thanks.</p>
      
        <p>So I went.</p>
      
        <p>I went to the gay section, I picked a couple of 30 or 40,</p>
      
        <p>and within 45 minutes, we found her in a fucking video.</p>
      
        <p>And I was like, what?</p>
      
        <p>And she was like, no.</p>
      
        <p>I wish I was a good person for doing that,</p>
      
        <p>but I gave her the tape and she got that shit solved.</p>
      
        <p>And it's nice to do that, but there's other times,</p>
      
        <p>this guy come in, he's like, could you help me?</p>
      
        <p>Joyce, I know that one.</p>
      
        <p>If I need to get up, just let me know.</p>
      
        <p>Okay?</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>But there's times I have to help people, right?</p>
      
        <p>This guy come in and say, hey, do you have some kind of chemical</p>
      
        <p>for my girlfriend?</p>
      
        <p>What do you need?</p>
      
        <p>Like, perfume, all that?</p>
      
        <p>And he's trying to be delicate, and I'm not trying to be offensive,</p>
      
        <p>but she has a particular smell down there,</p>
      
        <p>and it's hard for him to go down there,</p>
      
        <p>but he doesn't want to tell her because it's going to hurt her feelings.</p>
      
        <p>So he's suffering.</p>
      
        <p>He's suffering in silence.</p>
      
        <p>But he want to make sure she know without hurting her feelings.</p>
      
        <p>So I say, oh, so you want to make sure she know without telling her and not hurting her</p>
      
        <p>feelings.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Listen to Uncle Yoshi.</p>
      
        <p>This is what you do.</p>
      
        <p>You get two fingers, just while you're having consented sex, just jam it in her vagina for</p>
      
        <p>a long time.</p>
      
        <p>And when you do it for a long time, hold it out until you have a long, thick liquid across.</p>
      
        <p>Damn.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to have to do this.</p>
      
        <p>You put it in her mouth, then she knows.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Chimo, quickly knock it off, okay?</p>
      
        <p>Would you agree if you have a good intention when you want to help somebody, sometimes</p>
      
        <p>you have unconventional – so, you know, you live the lie.</p>
      
        <p>You know, sometimes you have perfect solutions, you want to help, but you know, you're a young</p>
      
        <p>guy, you'll find out.</p>
      
        <p>You don't always have perfect solutions.</p>
      
        <p>You know, most Japanese are Buddhist,</p>
      
        <p>and we don't help homeless people and stuff</p>
      
        <p>because we believe in reincarnation.</p>
