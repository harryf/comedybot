    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>They're so good at finding out and they say that. And they say over and over until you break down and start crying.</p>
      
        <p>That's when this guy was saying a couple guys that have sex with him.</p>
      
        <p>He'll do shit like that.</p>
      
        <p>So, when Bush became president a second time, he left the business, he disappeared.</p>
      
        <p>And we've been working the last three years doing documents. And there's a reason why he disappeared.</p>
      
        <p>We think, I think he killed somebody. We're getting that information.</p>
      
        <p>And two, his name is Mark Handel. His brother, Bill Handel, is conservative radio personality that a lot of people don't know.</p>
      
        <p>He used to have a show before Rush Limbaugh.</p>
      
        <p>So, when 9-11, when that thing happened, Bill Handel was doing a radio show before Rush and they came to get him.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, there is a lot of really weird individuals involved.</p>
      
        <p>There's plenty of people doing sex. They love women. They want to talk to ladies.</p>
      
        <p>And I like the directors looking at ladies and talking to them.</p>
      
        <p>What are you into? Are you into this and that? And ask before the show if they film it.</p>
      
        <p>I like directors like that because they want to do things that women are into.</p>
      
        <p>And make the scene even better.</p>
      
        <p>And other extremists, guys who want to hurt women, they could find out right away what they're not into.</p>
      
        <p>And they will lie and do the same.</p>
      
        <p>So, we're going after him. And he's in jail for tax evasion, weirdly.</p>
      
        <p>That's how you get people in the media.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, I mean, you get to rape women and not go to jail.</p>
      
        <p>But if you fuck with, when you fuck the US government money, you go to jail.</p>
      
        <p>That's a very Swiss way of looking at it.</p>
      
        <p>But, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>We have one more question over here.</p>
      
        <p>Well, since Harry's question essentially covers some of it, but I have a little bit more on that.</p>
      
        <p>So, thank you for sharing all this.</p>
      
        <p>I really appreciate that you're available to talk about this.</p>
      
        <p>And if you're not available to talk more, you know, like...</p>
      
        <p>So, I remember watching this documentary and we were talking about this.</p>
      
        <p>The Dark Side of Porn was a documentary.</p>
      
        <p>That guy's in there. Condesh is in there.</p>
      
        <p>So, that was a BBC documentary.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And these people whose lives are ruined, right, because of some of these issues that you talked about.</p>
      
        <p>So, for instance, there is no consent, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, they end up, you know, like, because they cannot...</p>
      
        <p>There's some consent and some...</p>
      
        <p>It's supposed to stop as soon as someone decides they're no longer okay with it.</p>
      
        <p>But it goes on because there are so many other people.</p>
      
        <p>They're making money. They need to make the money.</p>
      
        <p>And there's a lot of pressure.</p>
      
        <p>So, it goes on.</p>
      
        <p>Although, that lady or the guy or the gal, right?</p>
      
        <p>It could be both ways.</p>
      
        <p>But it's...</p>
      
        <p>One imagines it's most of the times the women who do not want to do it anymore or something like that.</p>
      
        <p>I guess you could...</p>
      
        <p>So, and then there's the extreme case of it.</p>
      
        <p>And that's what I wanted to ask you about.</p>
      
        <p>Sure.</p>
      
        <p>So, diseases.</p>
      
        <p>Life-ruining diseases.</p>
      
        <p>Have you seen any of that sort of thing happen?</p>
      
        <p>And essentially people...</p>
      
        <p>How does the conversation go from there, right?</p>
      
        <p>Because essentially that kind of thing...</p>
      
        <p>You don't have a disease?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah. HIV.</p>
      
        <p>Gonorrhea?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>You know, essentially you were talking about someone on stage with a very serious disease.</p>
      
        <p>And I just wonder if...</p>
      
        <p>Like, what happens after that, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, is that person...</p>
      
        <p>Is there any Italian people here?</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>So, no.</p>
      
        <p>It's good.</p>
      
        <p>There's two extreme examples.</p>
      
        <p>I'm sure some of you know Rocco Cervetti, right?</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>When I asked Rocco about that one time, the way he said that, like, I think he had gonorrhea</p>
      
        <p>multiple times or stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, in US military, you almost get killed and in bravery they give you purple</p>
      
        <p>heart.</p>
      
        <p>The way Rocco saw it, it was like getting gonorrhea.</p>
      
        <p>It's like his own version of purple heart.</p>
      
        <p>He kind of laughed about getting all kinds of different things.</p>
      
        <p>But...</p>
      
        <p>But my boss, John Stagliano, he tested positive HIV in 1997.</p>
      
        <p>And his wife, Karen Stagliano, tested positive HIV.</p>
      
        <p>And that's why we covered the pandemic where a guy named Mark Wallace, he knew he had HIV,</p>
      
        <p>but he put a fake testing.</p>
      
        <p>And so whenever there's incidents, one, I don't want this to happen.</p>
      
        <p>And two, it's a selfish reason.</p>
      
        <p>I don't want people who I know to have it.</p>
      
        <p>I don't want anybody to have it, but especially worse is you know somebody, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So whenever that happens, the industry shut down, where we do this, okay, these people</p>
      
        <p>have, they tested HIV.</p>
      
        <p>We do the backward track, like, okay, here's six or eight people.</p>
      
        <p>And we do another graph where who else did.</p>
      
        <p>So all the people we have, we go back like three months and we contact everyone and test</p>
      
        <p>all those people.</p>
      
        <p>So when COVID happened, the government or the basketball industry had to treat that shit?</p>
      
        <p>It's funny because in our documentary, we had, who, why am I forgetting, the head COVID</p>
      
        <p>czar of the USA.</p>
      
        <p>He's, we had him in our documentary.</p>
      
        <p>You know, really, as much sex they have in porn, it's amazing how little HIV positive</p>
      
        <p>thing happened, really.</p>
      
        <p>You know the thing, the thing I'm getting at, but it's an old stuff from you.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but it's a really good question.</p>
      
        <p>Is, is if you look at it, like if I think about my working life, I've always worked</p>
      
        <p>in software.</p>
      
        <p>There's always some people in your company who are that, it's like that, it's usually</p>
      
        <p>a guy, it's usually that guy.</p>
      
        <p>And, and what I'm getting from you is this is, this is business, this is a company you've</p>
      
        <p>got people you work with.</p>
      
        <p>And there's always some people that push it too far.</p>
      
        <p>And it's really a question of A, what your personally, what your boundaries are, what</p>
      
        <p>you stand up for.</p>
      
        <p>Were you prepared to say, hey, no, this is not okay.</p>
      
        <p>It's an individual.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>It's also like the culture around you, whether you've got people who say, hey, what you were</p>
      
        <p>doing to that person, that's not freaking cool.</p>
      
        <p>But can I also tell you something?</p>
      
        <p>Um, um, what was acceptable in eighties and nineties and two thousands different now.</p>
      
        <p>So sometimes when people say like, you know what, even some of the guy probably told me</p>
      
        <p>like it was acceptable back in 20 years ago, but now I feel like, um, I mean, you know,</p>
      
        <p>they would.</p>
      
        <p>And I think it's important to have that kind of understanding of what the culture is.</p>
      
        <p>And I think that's the most important thing.</p>
      
        <p>And I think it's a good example for you.</p>
      
        <p>What is a good example?</p>
      
        <p>Um, well, it's complicated because sometimes the girls need the money, so they say yes,</p>
      
        <p>knowing that they don't want to buy, you know, they will do seem even though they consented,</p>
      
        <p>they don't want to do it because of the money or whatnot.</p>
      
        <p>But that sounds like most of the jobs I've had in my life.</p>
      
        <p>That's true.</p>
      
        <p>But you don't have to addiction to answer why either.</p>
      
        <p>You don't know that.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, so you're right.</p>
      
        <p>You're right.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, so you're on Sunday night.</p>
      
        <p>It felt like it.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Fair enough.</p>
      
        <p>We have one more question over here.</p>
      
        <p>Do you want to, do you want to finish this?</p>
      
        <p>I want to tell you something because, um, I know a lot of people talk about pornography.</p>
      
        <p>Um, they'd say a lot of goofy stuff cause they never worked in, but, um, I feel so conflicted</p>
      
        <p>because there's the good and bad and ugly.</p>
      
        <p>I want to tell you this one quick thing and then maybe we could get out.</p>
      
        <p>This is the kind of thing that really made me change and think about, um, people who</p>
      
        <p>are like, Oh, I'm not going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>This is what I'm gonna do.</p>
      
        <p>This is what I'm going to do.</p>
      
        <p>Um, when I was working at the Time of Video Store one time, a customer walked in and uh,</p>
      
        <p>say hello and, but uh, I thought maybe he was shy.</p>
      
        <p>I see going, walking around and looking for tape and that's a mirror of the night, like</p>
      
        <p>one in the morning.</p>
      
        <p>It's snowing and we were getting a lot of customers and then, um, it intershines so</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to bother, but he walked up and said, Hey, so could you help me and find a</p>
      
        <p>movie?</p>
      
        <p>And I'm sure that's my job.</p>
      
        <p>Um, to help you find a movie.</p>
      
        <p>And, um, he said, um, I need your help.</p>
      
        <p>Can you help me with the subject matter?</p>
      
        <p>I need you to help me find my daughter.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, so me when I heard that,</p>
      
        <p>I'm a comedian so I'm laughing inside,</p>
      
        <p>so I thought maybe he found out</p>
      
        <p>that his daughter's doing a porn,</p>
      
        <p>and get one to get a copy and evidence.</p>
      
        <p>Unfortunately that wasn't the case.</p>
      
        <p>What happened was,</p>
      
        <p>what happened was his daughter got killed</p>
      
        <p>in a car accident.</p>
      
        <p>And when she was going to college,</p>
      
        <p>it's one of those nights when her and her friends,</p>
      
        <p>girls night out, I don't know how it is over here,</p>
      
        <p>but there was strip club, right?</p>
      
        <p>And when they went to strip club,</p>
      
        <p>it just happened that night,</p>
      
        <p>they were shooting a scene at the strip club</p>
      
        <p>for one of the porno movie.</p>
      
        <p>So what happened was,</p>
      
        <p>it was literally, they were shooting the audience scene,</p>
      
        <p>when you're walking you have to agree,</p>
      
        <p>like they're gonna film it, they're okay.</p>
      
        <p>So the reason why he was asked for this movie</p>
      
        <p>is literally the last live footage of his daughter</p>
      
        <p>in background at the strip club, you know?</p>
      
        <p>I'm a pervert, I'm not a monster,</p>
      
        <p>I wanna help him find the movie,</p>
      
        <p>but he doesn't have a title,</p>
      
        <p>he doesn't have production, none of it, right?</p>
      
        <p>So you gotta understand, I have like close to 10,000 copies.</p>
      
        <p>He's visiting from Canada, his flight is on 560 Honours.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, assuming even if we have the tape here,</p>
      
        <p>how do I find it, because it's not like a porn star name,</p>
      
        <p>I'm gonna collect the stage name.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm doing my best ability, like,</p>
      
        <p>he told me the kind of scene, I'm picking a movie,</p>
      
        <p>and we have a video, she says, we put the tape,</p>
      
        <p>we're fast forward looking for him, or looking for her,</p>
      
        <p>and every time a customer comes in, I have to stop.</p>
      
        <p>And like one hour pass, two hour pass, three hour pass,</p>
      
        <p>I'm getting desperate, I really wanna help him,</p>
      
        <p>but I'm desperate, and we can't find the movie,</p>
      
        <p>and then, so what I did was,</p>
      
        <p>I called one of the customer that shops a lot,</p>
      
        <p>we call him the Yoda perversion,</p>
      
        <p>because he was so much more, he knows a lot,</p>
      
        <p>so we called him 6 AM, you know,</p>
      
        <p>and he was so angry, because he told his wife,</p>
      
        <p>he doesn't watch porn anymore,</p>
      
        <p>and this motherfucker watched a lot of porn, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, Glenn, I didn't know what to do,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I wanna help the guy, I was watching, he's mad,</p>
      
        <p>but after I told him the situation,</p>
      
        <p>he's got a daughter too, like he wanna help,</p>
      
        <p>so he said, you check here and here and here and here,</p>
      
        <p>and I told him, of course, I'm not an idiot,</p>
      
        <p>I went to all those places, so he said,</p>
      
        <p>did you look at the gay section?</p>
      
        <p>I said, Glenn, we're looking for a bunch of male strippers</p>
      
        <p>dancing for these ladies, you don't understand,</p>
      
        <p>many of the male strippers are gay men,</p>
      
        <p>so chances are, you're probably finding a gay section,</p>
      
        <p>so I didn't know that, because you know,</p>
      
        <p>I think at that point, it was like half a year into it,</p>
      
        <p>I'm still learning, so I went to gay section,</p>
      
        <p>look at the, because I didn't even bother that section,</p>
      
        <p>I went through all the movie,</p>
      
        <p>I looked at the box cover, and I looked at the ones,</p>
      
        <p>like guys from like, strip club or whatever,</p>
      
        <p>you know, like I didn't, so I took like 40 of those,</p>
      
        <p>and I think like, within 30, 40 minutes,</p>
      
        <p>we find the fucking date with his daughter in it,</p>
      
        <p>and you know, and you have a daughter too,</p>
      
        <p>like that's the first time I saw a guy cry at the porn shop,</p>
      
        <p>you know, that's not a really common human,</p>
      
        <p>most guys,</p>
      
        <p>you know, they take them, take them,</p>
      
        <p>they're like, they're happy,</p>
      
        <p>they're gonna go, oh, I'm jacked off to it,</p>
      
        <p>crying is not one of them, but anyway,</p>
      
        <p>I think when I had experience like that, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I don't have a kid, I help them,</p>
      
        <p>and I did a show with Amber last year,</p>
      
        <p>and the name of the show is, Adult Content,</p>
      
        <p>and it's a, I misunderstood the phrase when I heard it,</p>
      
        <p>when I was kid, I thought it meant,</p>
      
        <p>adult content as in happiness, I thought,</p>
      
        <p>so my show was about, adult happiness,</p>
      
        <p>because a lot of time, it, sex is overrated,</p>
      
        <p>it's never as good as you think it is</p>
      
        <p>when you have sex with someone for the first time,</p>
      
        <p>the fantasy's so much better than the real thing,</p>
      
        <p>and a lot of time, when I'm dealing with a customer,</p>
