        <p>I'm gonna put one finger in you.</p>
      
        <p>So you should just relax.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, um...</p>
      
        <p>It's gonna go in, so, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, you know what's so surprising about fisting for you guys?</p>
      
        <p>It can't be romantic thing, right?</p>
      
        <p>I mean, it can't be, ladies.</p>
      
        <p>Imagine your real boyfriend pulled it out and opened, there's a wedding ring.</p>
      
        <p>Ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
      
        <p>It could be nice.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, come on.</p>
      
        <p>Ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>So I think a lot of comedians know me in the States,</p>
      
        <p>because prior to doing comedy, I...</p>
      
        <p>This is a true story.</p>
      
        <p>I was editing porn movies in Los Angeles for like nine years.</p>
      
        <p>Before that, retail shop for another five.</p>
      
        <p>And I've been consulting like anything related to adult movies in the States.</p>
      
        <p>So anytime they need like a porn star for movies or TV in the States,</p>
      
        <p>they contact me and I kind of consult.</p>
      
        <p>So, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>Are they mean to you?</p>
      
        <p>Are they mean to getting into the business?</p>
      
        <p>I did.</p>
      
        <p>And believe me, no Asian parents want to have a son working for a guy named Buttman, right?</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>Whose house just got burned down in Malibu.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, um...</p>
      
        <p>True story, first time.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
      
        <p>No, I'm not.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'll give you a job selling and you feel like, you know.</p>
      
        <p>But, um...</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>The company I used to work for is named called Evil Angel, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, my parents were always like embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>Like, what did your son do?</p>
      
        <p>You know what my parents tell them?</p>
      
        <p>My son works for EA.</p>
      
        <p>For those of you who play video games, you know, electronic art.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, so, um...</p>
      
        <p>Completely different business.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, um...</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
      
        <p>I did a show called Adult Content in French two years ago.</p>
      
        <p>So, can I tell you a couple of stories?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not...</p>
      
        <p>I'll try not to be gross like Harry.</p>
      
        <p>But, um...</p>
      
        <p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>So, going back to fisting.</p>
      
        <p>Let's talk about that first.</p>
      
        <p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
      
        <p>In 2007 and 8, we were facing crisis in adult business because financial crisis.</p>
      
        <p>Also, invention of iPhone and porn hub was invented right here.</p>
      
        <p>So, we were losing a lot of business.</p>
      
        <p>It's not that there was less demand.</p>
      
        <p>It's just that we didn't have a lot of money.</p>
      
        <p>We didn't have...</p>
      
        <p>It's not that there was less demand in porn.</p>
      
        <p>It's just that people are not paying for it.</p>
      
        <p>And, uh...</p>
      
        <p>So, my boss thought, bright idea, we need to start making new movies to attract new</p>
      
        <p>customers.</p>
      
        <p>So, he thought we needed to make fisting movies.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>I have no idea why.</p>
      
        <p>Ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
      
        <p>But this is the law in United States.</p>
      
        <p>Uh, like, you can put almost anything online.</p>
      
        <p>As soon as you put a DVD or VHS at the time, you're judged by local community standards.</p>
      
        <p>So, we have to be careful what we put there.</p>
      
        <p>So, fisting's legal in United States as long as it's legal in the United States.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So, the first thing we did was we created a new movie.</p>
      
        <p>We were very proud of it.</p>
      
        <p>So, we had a lot of fans.</p>
      
        <p>Everybody was very welcome to watch this movie.</p>
      
        <p>I think we had about three hundred fifty people watching.</p>
      
        <p>One hundred fifty left over.</p>
      
        <p>And so, we Langstar gave a rose.</p>
      
        <p>Its free.</p>
      
        <p>We had pretty cool movie.</p>
      
        <p>I had, um...</p>
      
        <p>Great</p>
      
        <p>That's a lot!</p>
      
        <p>So, I asked my boss, I was like, Chris, well what happens if a person is missing a thumb?</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>Because laws strictly say you can't put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>Obviously, somebody missing a thumb couldn't logically put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>So, there is a particular crim cultivation law.</p>
      
        <p>I don't believe that law...</p>
      
        <p>I don't believe that law.</p>
      
        <p>person could put all the way in somebody's mouth, anus, and vagina. I don't know why</p>
      
        <p>I keep looking at you. Anyway, that particular person is legal to do that. In porn business,</p>
      
        <p>this is known as rule of thumb.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm saying it, but prior to that, you know, well, okay, here's another one when</p>
      
        <p>we have to deal with movies, right? Here's a typical thing I have to deal with, no matter</p>
      
        <p>how ridiculous it sounds to you. So, one time, this guy was having anal sex with this girl,</p>
      
        <p>and he put too much lube on his penis. So, one time, he went in, pulled it out, all this</p>
      
        <p>liquid flew out of her ass, right? Which is fine. Which is fine. I mean, I call that Wednesday,</p>
      
        <p>but anyway.</p>
      
        <p>The problem was the...</p>
      
        <p>The color of the liquid was ambiguous.</p>
      
        <p>What that means is some people might think some of it was shit. You can't have shit in</p>
      
        <p>there. It's illegal back then, you know? So, here I am. I don't have a perfectly good eyesight.</p>
      
        <p>I gotta, you know, use my editing to go in, in, out, in, out, back and forth, right? Because</p>
      
        <p>the color... And I really honestly can't figure out...</p>
      
        <p>Because sometimes it looks clear, another time it looks a little brownish-orange color,</p>
      
        <p>right?</p>
      
        <p>So, what I have to do when I can't make a decision, I have to call my colleague in</p>
      
        <p>that room. Everybody has to come in. There's eight of us, and we're looking at this footage</p>
      
        <p>together. It is though, this is like Supreme Court decision that we have to make right</p>
      
        <p>now.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, this is... I was in my 40s when I...</p>
      
        <p>So, like...</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>Fosse, yay.</p>
      
        <p>Fosse, nay.</p>
      
        <p>Fosse, nay.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So, uh...</p>
      
        <p>But isn't it interesting? Like, like, the thumb, thumb law and, like, the color of shit,</p>
      
        <p>some American lawmakers have sat down in, like, a debate and make these laws. You know</p>
      
        <p>what I mean? Like, these are not garbage. They literally have to sit down... They went</p>
      
        <p>to law school, governor of my wonderful country, but somebody had to sit down and say, these</p>
      
        <p>are the things you could do and you cannot do.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, it's very quiet. Okay, anyway.</p>
