        <p>And when I went to Afghanistan, I went to Afghanistan for vacation three times in my</p>
      
        <p>life.</p>
      
        <p>For vacations?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I know people.</p>
      
        <p>This is more of a question.</p>
      
        <p>Like I'm going to Ukraine January 1st.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, so.</p>
      
        <p>Have you seen the beaches?</p>
      
        <p>They're amazing.</p>
      
        <p>And empty.</p>
      
        <p>My friend Kim, she's American practicing law in Afghanistan.</p>
      
        <p>She said, hey, you want to go to Policharki prison, which is the biggest prison in Afghanistan?</p>
      
        <p>Of course.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, you know, she would never ask a black person to go to prison.</p>
      
        <p>So even though it's their natural habitat, they're not going to go to prison.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm like, I'm going to go to prison.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to go to prison.</p>
      
        <p>So I went, so I ended up talking to three foreigners.</p>
      
        <p>One American, one English, Australian, I don't know which,â€‹ ict easily work, but it</p>
      
        <p>So she's talking to a bunch of them.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm in the courtyard inside of the prison.</p>
      
        <p>And they don't know me.</p>
      
        <p>And they're suspicious.</p>
      
        <p>Until Kim told them, by the way, you should work for porn.</p>
      
        <p>So here's the thing.</p>
      
        <p>When you work for porn, just like, I don't know if you ever saw the show Generation Kill.</p>
      
        <p>They embedded this guy.</p>
      
        <p>He was a journalist.</p>
      
        <p>The only reason Marine trusted him, because prior to becoming a real journalist, he wrote for Hustler.</p>
      
        <p>And every young guy don't trust New York Times, but they definitely trust Hustler magazine.</p>
      
        <p>So when you work in porn, even the racial thing, you could surpass that.</p>
      
        <p>Because as soon as I told them, like, porno stuff, and when they ask me questions, I know the detail of all the different girls.</p>
      
        <p>Because think about it.</p>
      
        <p>What is porn?</p>
      
        <p>You have a bunch of people showing their assholes.</p>
      
        <p>They're showing their dick and pussy, their tits.</p>
      
        <p>They got liquid all over them.</p>
      
        <p>It's a very honest.</p>
      
        <p>They don't really hide anything, do they?</p>
      
        <p>So it's the most honest people you're ever going to meet.</p>
      
        <p>The most down-to-earth people.</p>
      
        <p>As soon as I told porn, people like, black people usually don't like Asian people, right?</p>
      
        <p>But as soon as I work in porn, you know, I'm like a friend.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>So that's my favorite part.</p>
