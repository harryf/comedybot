        <p>Sex is very uncomfortable.</p>
      
        <p>To me, sex is the second most uncomfortable conversation.</p>
      
        <p>So you're probably gonna ask, what's the number one most uncomfortable conversation?</p>
      
        <p>I think talking about money, which it's not, because this is Switzerland.</p>
      
        <p>This is all about money over here.</p>
      
        <p>But sex and money is a really uncomfortable conversation.</p>
      
        <p>So, when you say pornographic, you know, I'll be very clear.</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, don't worry, I didn't put the phone in front of the camera.</p>
      
        <p>But people ask me, because this is not a very polite conversation,</p>
      
        <p>people ask me all the time, since I work in the business for a long time,</p>
      
        <p>like, Yoshi, do you hate women?</p>
      
        <p>That's a good question, if you work in porn.</p>
      
        <p>Simple answer is no.</p>
      
        <p>But I do have a complicated relationship with women.</p>
      
        <p>Well, a woman. My mother.</p>
      
        <p>It's very complicated because my mother, it's not like an Asian thing,</p>
      
        <p>she was a very difficult...</p>
      
        <p>So, are you familiar with chicken pox?</p>
      
        <p>So when you get sick.</p>
      
        <p>Chicken pox.</p>
      
        <p>Chicken pox, sorry.</p>
      
        <p>And, um...</p>
      
        <p>Oh.</p>
      
        <p>So, okay.</p>
      
        <p>By the way, if I don't make any sense, just raise your hand, I'll re-explain.</p>
      
        <p>Um, so I think I was like five or six, I had chicken pox, and I was sick.</p>
      
        <p>And my mom dragged me out of the house, and I'm really sick,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I'm just covered with...</p>
      
        <p>And pox all over.</p>
      
        <p>She takes me a couple blocks away from the house,</p>
      
        <p>into this narrow alleyway, and there's all these markets,</p>
      
        <p>there's a lot of people walking.</p>
      
        <p>She takes me over there.</p>
      
        <p>There's three of her friends standing there.</p>
      
        <p>So they're talking, all of a sudden, they see me,</p>
      
        <p>they turn around and look at me.</p>
      
        <p>The three women were my mom's friends.</p>
      
        <p>They look, so I'm kind of confused, I'm sick.</p>
      
        <p>You know what my mother does?</p>
      
        <p>She comes over and pulls my pants down.</p>
      
        <p>She'll my dick with chicken pox on it.</p>
      
        <p>And they start laughing.</p>
      
        <p>Here's the thing, ladies.</p>
      
        <p>That's the first time I had a group of women laughing at me.</p>
      
        <p>But that wasn't the last time, believe me.</p>
      
        <p>So, and my mom just leaves with her friend.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm like five or six with my little dick sticking out.</p>
      
        <p>And of course I love my mom, so I'm chasing her like a penguin,</p>
      
        <p>because, you know, my pants is down there.</p>
      
        <p>So my mom's always been very difficult.</p>
      
        <p>So this is the reason why I have a little bit of a complicated</p>
      
        <p>relationship with women.</p>
      
        <p>And Harry loves that.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
