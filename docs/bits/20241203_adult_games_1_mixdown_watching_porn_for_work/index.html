        <p>Oh, okay, okay.</p>
      
        <p>When you're ready.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, okay, taking a break.</p>
      
        <p>And then there's a chance to do the podcast.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, okay, okay.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, so I'll do one, do I have,</p>
      
        <p>one other thing I wanna do is like because I was in show business</p>
      
        <p>in L.A., you mean all the interesting people right,</p>
      
        <p>like the people you went to, so one of my friends performed</p>
      
        <p>Tonight Show and when I met them and when they find out I work</p>
      
        <p>in porn, after that what happened from 2006,</p>
      
        <p>Every time any Hollywood star said they like porn,</p>
      
        <p>they would call me, I'd bring boxes of porn for them.</p>
      
        <p>So like Seth Rogen, you know, I met him because,</p>
      
        <p>you know, pornography and stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>Well, one time I went there and President Trump was there.</p>
      
        <p>Well, he wasn't president yet.</p>
      
        <p>He was there and so I met him, right?</p>
      
        <p>Whatever.</p>
      
        <p>Until this election, I'll finish with this.</p>
      
        <p>Prior to this election, I noticed that pornography</p>
      
        <p>have an amazing ability to predict who's gonna be</p>
      
        <p>a president of the United States.</p>
      
        <p>So year 2000, 2004, a lot of the porn was kinda mean.</p>
      
        <p>Like, well, remember 2000, well, 2000, 2004,</p>
      
        <p>Bush was president, so he used to do like a lot of torture</p>
      
        <p>in Guantanamo Bay, waterboarding.</p>
      
        <p>Back then, we were doing a lot of mean porn</p>
      
        <p>where they would put the girl's head in the toilet</p>
      
        <p>like a waterboard.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like, you know, like,</p>
      
        <p>they would do a lot of mean things like that.</p>
      
        <p>So we thought like, because at the time,</p>
      
        <p>for whatever reason, it was so mean,</p>
      
        <p>2000, 2004 election, we thought Bush was gonna win, he won.</p>
      
        <p>Then around 2000 and 2012,</p>
      
        <p>most popular porn was interracial porn.</p>
      
        <p>So we knew like, Obama's gonna win this shit.</p>
      
        <p>And for some reason, 2016, a lot of the porn</p>
      
        <p>was like incest porn, you know, like stepdaughter.</p>
      
        <p>And every time President Trump was running,</p>
      
        <p>he said like, if Ivanka wasn't my daughter, I would hate her.</p>
      
        <p>So we thought like, this motherfucker's gonna win.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>And then last election, for whatever reason,</p>
      
        <p>like a lot of senior citizens,</p>
      
        <p>like the dementia porn was popular.</p>
      
        <p>Like, it's fucking Biden, you know?</p>
      
        <p>But I don't know what to make of this election, this one,</p>
      
        <p>because none of the porn kind of indicated.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, I mean, if you have a question, I'm not an expert,</p>
      
        <p>but I went to every one of those, like,</p>
      
        <p>Epstein, Gehling, all those court cases.</p>
      
        <p>And I have a question.</p>
      
        <p>I have a question for ladies about the Mazin rape case in France,</p>
      
        <p>because I'm going last three days for the court.</p>
      
        <p>So maybe ladies should answer my question.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      
        <p>Let's take a break.</p>
