        <p>I don't know if that makes sense.</p>
      
        <p>No, it does.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Definitely does.</p>
      
        <p>So, it's an art thing.</p>
      
        <p>Eventually, it kind of...</p>
      
        <p>We have another question over here.</p>
      
        <p>This is so serious.</p>
      
        <p>I don't even think it's...</p>
      
        <p>It's weird.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what I'm...</p>
      
        <p>I was wondering if you could comment on like, what do you think, like, how big is the percentage</p>
      
        <p>of female porn?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Female porn workers who are actually in the business out of passion because they actually</p>
      
        <p>love it.</p>
      
        <p>And how big is the percentage of women who are kind of like, forced kind of like into</p>
      
        <p>the situation out of financial reasons or other things?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I think that's a very good question.</p>
      
        <p>And my friend Peter Warren, he's an editor for ABN, Adobe Video News.</p>
      
        <p>It's a big magazine that covered adult business.</p>
      
        <p>And they're competitive as ex-biz.</p>
      
        <p>And ABN also sponsored the big porn show, abortion porn show.</p>
      
        <p>And I think this is the first of five of them that has eachinding to곳.</p>
      
        <p>And literally, that person seemingly not...</p>
      
        <p>If I can just ask him one question, with context here, what is ABN doing to spices up</p>
      
        <p>their sexy isfy, eye piercing, abdominal, questioned.</p>
      
        <p>That's another thing that Peter just did.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Father Sir都有 uma...</p>
      
        <p>Just now I was asking to my friend, Peter Warren, that's an interesting question,</p>
      
        <p>and you'll probably get the wrong idea, but yeah, a lot of us want to know what this idea</p>
      
        <p>is.</p>
      
        <p>I have my own personal opinion.</p>
      
        <p>And that's really honest and single and crystal clear.</p>
      
        <p>And just for, you know, some winner if you want to Jeff honey that it and.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you're not.</p>
      
        <p>They don't want to share things because they're not Carolina, they don't even think about that</p>
      
        <p>for the time being.</p>
      
        <p>And I think early 2000 when I saw a lot of European stars, especially from Eastern Europe, I think they were a little different. I think they come from poor country and a lot of them were saying, look, we cannot make this kind of money where I'm from.</p>
      
        <p>And I could make so much money to the point where it's a generational wealth. So they were telling me, look, maybe they don't like me, but the kind of money that I bring, my family will never have to worry.</p>
      
        <p>And the smart ones, they go back to like, I don't know, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary, that they spend the money on a hotel and buy business. They're okay. Of course, there's many cases where they give their money to their suitcase pen for slash husband and they take the money.</p>
      
        <p>It's a tough one. I mean, I wish I could say that they did it because they're sexually liberated and they want to do, but I think the situation is a lot more complicated.</p>
      
        <p>It's a tough question. What were your limits in this industry? Was there a point where certain people you were like, I'm not going to work with that person?</p>
      
        <p>I'm behind the scene.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, but if people you would have an issue with.</p>
      
        <p>Right now, so I produce and consult on a document for a pandemic. I think we released it like five years ago. There was an HIV outbreak in 1997. And we tried to figure out how that happened.</p>
      
        <p>And here's a weird thing about documentary, you know, like, I thought it happened for a letter A reason.</p>
      
        <p>After we did research and interview everyone.</p>
      
        <p>I was wrong. It was a reason B.</p>
      
        <p>You know, what was I giving you the documentary that was based on? What was your question?</p>
      
        <p>My question was there any one of you like this person is an asshole?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, okay. I'm working on a second documentary. A guy, his stage name is Confusion, which in English means like, you know, turn your arm or what is it the kind of like a body injury?</p>
      
        <p>This.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, but he spelled it K-H-A-N like Genghis Khan space Tujun. And what he does in the movies, you never see him.</p>
      
        <p>He, if you're a new porn girl and you're strong, like you could say all kinds of terrible things to her. It doesn't impact her. That's fine.</p>
      
        <p>Like, Annette Schwartz, she's a German porn star. You could not say anything to her to unface her. She's very strong.</p>
      
        <p>A guy like Confusion in porn business, there is a small percentage of these guys, they really want her women.</p>
      
        <p>And what he does is he verbally finds some, like, we all have a sensitive part, right?</p>
