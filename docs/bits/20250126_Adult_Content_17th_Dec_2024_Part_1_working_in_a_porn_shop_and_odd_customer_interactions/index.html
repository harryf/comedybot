        <p>So we had a basement, right?</p>
      
        <p>I had like, so I find magazine, whatever, they're all stuck together.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like in the basement.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like in the basement.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like Indiana Jones or something.</p>
      
        <p>Like I'm an archeologist.</p>
      
        <p>I'm trying to rewind this.</p>
      
        <p>Porn magazine.</p>
      
        <p>So there's like, I'm hiding all this stuff.</p>
      
        <p>So I had like 10 buckets, basement.</p>
      
        <p>I have all this magazine in a bucket of water.</p>
      
        <p>And within a couple of days, you could take it out, put it on a little rope and dry them out.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So, so these like use porn.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>What's that?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>It's not even like a comedy.</p>
      
        <p>So it's like that.</p>
      
        <p>It's like AA meeting, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Now if you have a question, you feel free to ask.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, you know, I will fix this porn.</p>
      
        <p>I used to sell on make money, but back then if you're, if you're a kid, that's the tiniest</p>
      
        <p>amount of money.</p>
      
        <p>So I kind of grew up in that, um, in my neighborhood in Japan, there's a lot of sixth workers or</p>
      
        <p>survival set.</p>
      
        <p>grocery store we were selling</p>
      
        <p>and I was even doing that</p>
      
        <p>when I was</p>
      
        <p>junior in high school</p>
      
        <p>because you know the timing of school when you start</p>
      
        <p>in Japan it was different so I was already like</p>
      
        <p>18 at the tail end of</p>
      
        <p>junior high school so what I used to do is</p>
      
        <p>I used to go to like warehouse</p>
      
        <p>buy porn magazines, VHS, porn</p>
      
        <p>I was selling them on the side</p>
      
        <p>at high school</p>
      
        <p>in the 80s right</p>
      
        <p>so I was doing that kind of stuff so I was</p>
      
        <p>pretty much kind of open minded</p>
      
        <p>about desktop</p>
      
        <p>well</p>
      
        <p>late 90s</p>
      
        <p>when my friend Tana Manoon</p>
      
        <p>he's a very funny comedian</p>
      
        <p>and he was telling me</p>
      
        <p>he was working at a porn shop at the time</p>
      
        <p>how much money they were making</p>
      
        <p>I thought there's no way you were making that kind of money</p>
      
        <p>he brought</p>
      
        <p>bookkeeping books</p>
      
        <p>and showed me the balance sheet</p>
      
        <p>it's amazing prior to</p>
      
        <p>online porn business</p>
      
        <p>how much money they were making</p>
      
        <p>so I thought</p>
      
        <p>you know</p>
      
        <p>my family is suffering</p>
      
        <p>lack of money</p>
      
        <p>why not work at a porn shop</p>
      
        <p>start a business</p>
      
        <p>so that's how I kind of</p>
      
        <p>got into the business late 90s</p>
      
        <p>so here's a couple of examples</p>
      
        <p>what was like for me</p>
      
        <p>working in a porn shop</p>
      
        <p>one time</p>
      
        <p>I was working there</p>
      
        <p>so I work at a midnight shift</p>
      
        <p>and you know how you go to an Apple store</p>
      
        <p>you have a genius bar</p>
      
        <p>well if you go to a porn shop</p>
      
        <p>you got a pervert bar</p>
      
        <p>you know</p>
      
        <p>I'm the expert pervert</p>
      
        <p>for the shop right</p>
      
        <p>I'm here to serve</p>
      
        <p>but sometimes people ask me things</p>
      
        <p>you know</p>
      
        <p>like I remember this lady</p>
      
        <p>walk in one night</p>
      
        <p>like one in the morning</p>
      
        <p>and say</p>
      
        <p>I fucked my son</p>
      
        <p>then she walked out of the fucking shop</p>
      
        <p>without not buying anything right</p>
      
        <p>that's a pretty heavy thing to say</p>
      
        <p>to me</p>
      
        <p>or another guy walk in and say</p>
      
        <p>I fucked my stepdaughter</p>
      
        <p>you know</p>
      
        <p>and then</p>
      
        <p>I think</p>
      
        <p>sometimes people come to the point</p>
      
        <p>that they're like</p>
      
        <p>oh it's a porn shop</p>
      
        <p>not necessarily buying stuff</p>
      
        <p>but because</p>
      
        <p>they're kind of trouble</p>
      
        <p>and they need help</p>
      
        <p>you know</p>
      
        <p>so</p>
      
        <p>and for my mind</p>
      
        <p>I'm just</p>
      
        <p>I'm just a pervert working there</p>
      
        <p>right</p>
      
        <p>so</p>
      
        <p>so this is one of Harry's favorite one</p>
