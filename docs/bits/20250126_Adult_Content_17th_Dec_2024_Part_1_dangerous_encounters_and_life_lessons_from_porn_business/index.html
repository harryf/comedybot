        <p>I didn't make any money,</p>
      
        <p>but it is nice when you get to be a little generous with people,</p>
      
        <p>you know, because you don't get to do this all the time.</p>
      
        <p>And so that was cool.</p>
      
        <p>And sometimes,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes there's like the difficult things, you know,</p>
      
        <p>like I remember a guy walking at like 2 in the morning</p>
      
        <p>because at that time it was like snow,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I'm trapped in Seattle.</p>
      
        <p>I don't think I can have any customer.</p>
      
        <p>A guy walks in really well-dressed,</p>
      
        <p>Ralph Lauren jacket and really nice looking guy,</p>
      
        <p>late 40s, early 50s, late 90s,</p>
      
        <p>in an atypical custom porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>You know, people don't really dress that well for a shop like that.</p>
      
        <p>I said hello.</p>
      
        <p>He doesn't say anything.</p>
      
        <p>He walks in and then he starts shopping around.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, because if they're shy,</p>
      
        <p>I'm gonna leave them alone.</p>
      
        <p>10 minutes later, he walks up,</p>
      
        <p>he says, could you help me find a movie?</p>
      
        <p>Of course, you know, that's my job.</p>
      
        <p>So I asked him like, do you have this porn star's name,</p>
      
        <p>production company, fetish and things like that?</p>
      
        <p>Every question was no, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>And I told him, sir, you know,</p>
      
        <p>we have about 10, 11,000 titles in here.</p>
      
        <p>Even if we have the movie, you know,</p>
      
        <p>based on so little information,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if I could help you with the movie you're looking for.</p>
      
        <p>And he paused.</p>
      
        <p>And looked down and said, well,</p>
      
        <p>I really hope you could help me find my daughter.</p>
      
        <p>And and of course, you know, my first reaction was, of course,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I was kind of laughing inside because</p>
      
        <p>I thought maybe she was doing a porn that I want to confront her</p>
      
        <p>whether I need a copy or something like that.</p>
      
        <p>And then</p>
      
        <p>I was like,</p>
      
        <p>you said that the police.</p>
      
        <p>I don't speak German, so I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>Sadly, I wish that was a scenario.</p>
      
        <p>What happened was after talking to him,</p>
      
        <p>his daughter got killed in a car accident six months before that.</p>
      
        <p>And about eight, nine, ten,</p>
      
        <p>maybe 11 months prior to that when she was going to college,</p>
      
        <p>one of the night, her and her friends had a gross night out with a strip club.</p>
      
        <p>And she was like,</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to go to the strip club.</p>
      
        <p>And they just happened to be filming extra scene for one of the porn of higher budget</p>
      
        <p>for the movie.</p>
      
        <p>And she just happened to be in the audience.</p>
      
        <p>And sounds like it's probably like last live footage of his daughter.</p>
      
        <p>So he's visiting from Canada.</p>
      
        <p>I would like to find this movie.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, I'm a pervert, but I'm not a monster.</p>
      
        <p>I would like to help.</p>
      
        <p>But, you know, even if you have it,</p>
      
        <p>there's 11,000 VHS DVDs, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I want to help.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't want to do it.</p>
      
        <p>But I used my high pervert IQ trying to kind of guess which take might happen.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, every time I'm playing, fast forward,</p>
      
        <p>we can't find the girl, a customer coming, I can stop.</p>
      
        <p>You know, a couple hours later, I'm still getting the phone.</p>
      
        <p>So it's like one, two, three, five, six, seven AM.</p>
      
        <p>He's got to fly at noon.</p>
      
        <p>I've got to leave soon.</p>
      
        <p>I don't think my coworkers replacing me will be very favorable trying to help this guy.</p>
      
        <p>So I didn't know what to do.</p>
      
        <p>So I made an executive decision.</p>
      
        <p>I called Glenn, who's like number one porn customer.</p>
      
        <p>They shopped with him for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>He's like my porn Yoda, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I called him.</p>
      
        <p>And he was very upset because, first of all, two reasons.</p>
      
        <p>One, it was very early in the morning, and he told his wife he doesn't watch porn anymore.</p>
      
        <p>It's a fucking lie.</p>
      
        <p>It's a lie because he doesn't buy movies.</p>
      
        <p>But what he does, he goes into those booths,</p>
      
        <p>put quarters, watch porn all day.</p>
      
        <p>So the fuckers still watch.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, after explaining to him the situation, of course, he's got kids too.</p>
      
        <p>So he asked me, Yoshi, did you go this section, this section?</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, Glenn, I'm not an idiot.</p>
      
        <p>Of course I went.</p>
      
        <p>Then he said, Yoshi, did you go to the yellow and green section?</p>
      
        <p>And yellow and green, back then we have a different sticker for different movies that we see.</p>
      
        <p>So that's the pretty things bad.</p>
      
        <p>So red is heterosexual, blacks and BDSM.</p>
      
        <p>And then blue and yellow, blue and yellow was like gay and transgender porn.</p>
      
        <p>So like, why would I be yellow and, you know, those colors?</p>
      
        <p>Because many of the strippers tend to be gay men.</p>
      
        <p>They dance with women.</p>
      
        <p>So if you haven't had a chance to find the tape, why don't you check the gay section?</p>
      
        <p>So I went there and I took my educated kids based on the box.</p>
      
        <p>And I think 35, 40 men in my, we fucking find a movie with his daughter in it.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, it's really weird because they start crying.</p>
      
        <p>And usually men usually don't cry at porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, liquid does come out of the box.</p>
      
        <p>Liquid does come out of the body, but that's not the body part.</p>
      
        <p>You know.</p>
      
        <p>So it's a privilege when I have a chance to do stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I don't know, I have too much hair, but I don't know if you can see a circle here.</p>
      
        <p>Kind of.</p>
      
        <p>No?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>So Easter 2000, you know what's interesting?</p>
      
        <p>Holidays, the porn shop, the most busiest.</p>
      
        <p>Because they don't want to spend their family time with their family, with their stupid family.</p>
      
        <p>So they come to the porn shop on Christmas, Easter, and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>We make so much more money.</p>
      
        <p>But, so this guy comes in and clearly he shoplifting.</p>
      
        <p>So I stop him by the door entrance way.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know at the time.</p>
      
        <p>He just got out of prison that day.</p>
      
        <p>And he took PCP, which is like a horse tranquilizer.</p>
      
        <p>They give you a lot of strength.</p>
      
        <p>And I didn't know that.</p>
      
        <p>He's a small little fucker.</p>
      
        <p>I thought I could take him.</p>
      
        <p>Not true.</p>
      
        <p>And he pushed me through the door, hit my head against the pole.</p>
      
        <p>He takes off.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm an idiot.</p>
      
        <p>I just run up and grab him.</p>
      
        <p>He grabbed me and flipped me over the first time.</p>
      
        <p>I run back.</p>
      
        <p>I grab him.</p>
      
        <p>He flipped me the second time.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm trying to do my, I got 50 pounds.</p>
      
        <p>Well, okay.</p>
      
        <p>So I can't do metric.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So long.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry.</p>
      
        <p>In America, you know who knows metric system?</p>
      
        <p>Gun nuts and drug dealers.</p>
      
        <p>Criminals.</p>
      
        <p>So third time, my partner ran out with a baseball bat.</p>
      
        <p>He knocked him out.</p>
      
        <p>So it can be dangerous.</p>
      
        <p>And these are the kind of shit we deal with.</p>
      
        <p>Another time, I'm in a hospital.</p>
      
        <p>I'm in a hospital.</p>
      
        <p>They don't trust them.</p>
      
        <p>And look.</p>
