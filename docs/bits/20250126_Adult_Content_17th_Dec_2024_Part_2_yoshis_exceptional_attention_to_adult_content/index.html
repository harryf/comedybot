        <p>Like, they're not really into it.</p>
      
        <p>And like, I could kill right away.</p>
      
        <p>Like, can I give you an example?</p>
      
        <p>I have a bad eyesight,</p>
      
        <p>except for these situations.</p>
      
        <p>One time, we were watching TV, right,</p>
      
        <p>with me and my friends.</p>
      
        <p>We had a commercial on.</p>
      
        <p>It's one of those dumb commercials</p>
      
        <p>where everybody's exercising or whatever, right?</p>
      
        <p>And they're like, wow, did you see that?</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, what?</p>
      
        <p>They didn't see it.</p>
      
        <p>So you know those exercises</p>
      
        <p>when a girl lay flat,</p>
      
        <p>they raise their leg?</p>
      
        <p>Well, this one, they have a panty on.</p>
      
        <p>So as soon as she raises one leg,</p>
      
        <p>you can see one and a half lips.</p>
      
        <p>And like, I caught it.</p>
      
        <p>It's not that I'm not even there for like,</p>
      
        <p>not even like a second.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I caught it, right?</p>
      
        <p>I can't play baseball, basketball.</p>
      
        <p>I don't have any.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, stop lying down.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really good at catching it.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really good at catching it for some reason.</p>
      
        <p>Like, there...</p>
      
        <p>This is how good I was.</p>
      
        <p>It's like an icon.</p>
      
        <p>Imagine the recognition.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, that's...</p>
      
        <p>I mean, if you were showing me a guy</p>
      
        <p>from waist down from 2012 or earlier,</p>
      
        <p>I could usually tell whose dick that was.</p>
      
        <p>You know, because I've seen it so many times.</p>
      
        <p>Like, Eric Everhart almost bent to the left-hand side.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know,</p>
      
        <p>the other ones that look like a triangle dick on top.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, you know, you just...</p>
      
        <p>I've seen it so many times.</p>
      
        <p>I don't remember.</p>
      
        <p>But one time, this transgender girl,</p>
      
        <p>she used fake ID to work.</p>
      
        <p>So she had a fake ID that looked like 18.</p>
      
        <p>A couple years later,</p>
      
        <p>she started using her real ID.</p>
      
        <p>Well, there's a discrepancy in birthdays.</p>
      
        <p>And of course, nobody noticed it.</p>
      
        <p>Of course, I remember...</p>
      
        <p>For some reason, I remember, like,</p>
      
        <p>I caught that kind of stuff.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, I was like, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, we all have something we are good at.</p>
      
        <p>And that's what I was good at.</p>
      
        <p>I can't put...</p>
      
        <p>I can't share it together,</p>
      
        <p>but I could tell you, like,</p>
      
        <p>which tranny from which scene...</p>
      
        <p>It would be interesting if you had, like,</p>
      
        <p>a guidance counselor at school</p>
      
        <p>that was like,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, when you grow up,</p>
      
        <p>what do you want to be?</p>
      
        <p>I want to see vagina.</p>
      
        <p>But cover the question.</p>
