        <p>because you guys are a wonderful audience.</p>
      
        <p>I did, last time I was here, I did 10 shows</p>
      
        <p>at the Top Secret Club, and the first nine shows,</p>
      
        <p>it went extremely well.</p>
      
        <p>I got a little cocky, on the last show, I did American show.</p>
      
        <p>I don't wanna take exactly what I said, it was really bad.</p>
      
        <p>People got really upset with me.</p>
      
        <p>In fact, the guy writing the show</p>
      
        <p>wanna punch me in the face.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm a little, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I was not really that worried,</p>
      
        <p>because, you know, that's one thing I have to say</p>
      
        <p>about England, you know, nobody's got guns.</p>
      
        <p>So, that's a really good news for me.</p>
      
        <p>So, anyway, I just wanna get it out there.</p>
      
        <p>Since you don't know me, I wanna tell you a couple things.</p>
      
        <p>This happened about a couple years back.</p>
      
        <p>My roommate, Irish-American guy, Rick,</p>
      
        <p>he spent his lifetime dream to go to Japan.</p>
      
        <p>So, he went to Japan, and the only thing I have to do</p>
      
        <p>is make sure nothing happened to our apartment,</p>
      
        <p>and especially to his cat, Juanito.</p>
      
        <p>So, it was a couple days later, you know,</p>
      
        <p>as I'm walking into the apartment, huge explosion.</p>
      
        <p>It's like a couple days away from</p>
      
        <p>Full Ditch Life, which is American National Holiday,</p>
      
        <p>and the goddamn cat ran into the apartment,</p>
      
        <p>so I lost the cat.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm panicking, like, what do I do?</p>
      
        <p>Like, do I take a chance?</p>
      
        <p>Hopefully, I can find a cat within the next 14 days</p>
      
        <p>before he get back, or do I ruin his vacation by killing him?</p>
      
        <p>I really couldn't make a decision.</p>
      
        <p>So, this is what Rick's mom said,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son's cat,</p>
      
        <p>and you don't give him the opportunity to look for the cat,</p>
      
        <p>he's gonna resent you.</p>
      
        <p>And I thought, you know what?</p>
      
        <p>She's really right.</p>
      
        <p>So, I emailed him.</p>
      
        <p>Because of time difference,</p>
      
        <p>he finally called me 14 hours later.</p>
      
        <p>Have you ever had a conversation with somebody</p>
      
        <p>that's been clearly been crying for a long time?</p>
      
        <p>How could you hear an impact of his throat?</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, well, that wasn't the funny part.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, wait a minute.</p>
      
        <p>So, he said, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat,</p>
      
        <p>but I gotta say something to you.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my God.</p>
      
        <p>He's gonna ask him to move out.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat?</p>
      
        <p>He said, no.</p>
      
        <p>He's, uh...</p>
      
        <p>I'm from Japan.</p>
      
        <p>We don't eat our lord and savior Hello Kitty.</p>
      
        <p>So, uh...</p>
      
        <p>So, anyway, um...</p>
      
        <p>So, he begged me, and please, you know, whatever,</p>
      
        <p>like, before I come home, please, you know,</p>
      
        <p>your best of ability to look for my cat.</p>
      
        <p>So, like a crazy person, like midnight,</p>
      
        <p>3 a.m., 6 a.m., 9 noon.</p>
      
        <p>Like, every time I come home, I'm like,</p>
      
        <p>Every three hours, like a crazy person, I go out in the street, shaking the cat food,</p>
      
        <p>saying Juanito, like a crazy person.</p>
      
        <p>I have to admit, these kind of things does teach you empathy, because until that point,</p>
      
        <p>I never noticed like lost animal sight.</p>
      
        <p>All of a sudden, I get it now, you know, and I need to do it.</p>
      
        <p>And then one day passed, a week, and it's getting a couple days away from the day Greg</p>
      
        <p>came home, and I'm just panicking, you know, it's like, to me, it is like his child.</p>
      
        <p>So I was desperate, so I went to my friend Eddie Ip's podcast, and on the podcast, he</p>
      
        <p>said, please, you know, if you happen to live in LA, I live in Hollywood in H-Mund, and</p>
      
        <p>if you want to volunteer and help me, please contact me, and if you find the cat, that's</p>
      
        <p>even better.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, this is why I made a mistake, and I think it would work in London, it would not</p>
      
        <p>work in the United States.</p>
      
        <p>I made a mistake by giving my personal cell phone number.</p>
      
        <p>So I think, he told me within 24 hours, I think like 45, 50,000 people downloaded the</p>
      
        <p>episode.</p>
      
        <p>And, by the way, I live in Los Angeles.</p>
      
        <p>So I think within an hour, somebody said, hey, I think I found your cat.</p>
      
        <p>So I clicked the picture, and it's a picture of huge cock.</p>
      
        <p>And...</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>That's the thing.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a big fan of the cat.</p>
      
        <p>I kind of deserve it.</p>
      
        <p>You know what was the weird thing?</p>
      
        <p>I think when Rick finally showed up, he drove his motorcycle, and the goddamn cat reappeared.</p>
