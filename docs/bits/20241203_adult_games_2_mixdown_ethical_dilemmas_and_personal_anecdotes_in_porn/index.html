        <p>You know.</p>
      
        <p>You know how uncomfortable it is when I'm sitting waiting for the girl that I want to have sex with.</p>
      
        <p>I pay for her.</p>
      
        <p>I'm watching it and it's a movie I worked on.</p>
      
        <p>They're playing, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm just like, ah.</p>
      
        <p>And the reason I was a little embarrassed because it was one of those movies I worked on first year and I didn't do a good job.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of bad.</p>
      
        <p>But, you know, like I didn't edit right and I didn't check right and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>But it got really uncomfortable because now all of a sudden I see my friends fucking.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, to you these are fantasy figures.</p>
      
        <p>There's fantasy to you as Spider-Man is.</p>
      
        <p>But these are the people I know.</p>
      
        <p>So I saw people and to answer your question, if you're talking about something intimate and meaningful, it was really painful because I'm watching my friend Brandon fucking.</p>
      
        <p>But it was the first time I saw him because he killed himself six months before that.</p>
      
        <p>And I didn't really want to see that scene.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, this is a friend of mine I met in 1999.</p>
      
        <p>I've known him for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>And part of the reason why he killed himself is because he was living in Dublin, fell in love with a girl.</p>
      
        <p>But he always told me for like four years, soon as he was kind of joking to me, but soon as when I ran out of money, she's going to dump me.</p>
      
        <p>Well, what happened was soon as he ran out of money and no longer had a resort, he she took the kid away.</p>
      
        <p>So he's in another country as a Canadian, not an Irish person.</p>
      
        <p>On top of it, he's a pornographer.</p>
      
        <p>You really.</p>
      
        <p>He had no right.</p>
      
        <p>So do a lot of these people who fuck for seem for love, unless they're doing the same with their girlfriend, boyfriend or husband.</p>
      
        <p>Probably not.</p>
      
        <p>It's at the end of the day.</p>
      
        <p>And I think you will appreciate sex work is a work, you know, like whenever you make work out of fantasy, it's not fantasy anymore for us.</p>
      
        <p>You know how many times I'm sitting in the room like, please just come on your face so we could go home.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>We have one question.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>But.</p>
      
        <p>I'm.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, that's the.</p>
      
        <p>People are important.</p>
      
        <p>They don't have intimacy in their life.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, you're doing something very intimate, but it's a physical act, you know, and.</p>
      
        <p>The.</p>
      
        <p>There is intimacy, not like having sex with love or whatever, but there's there's genuine caring before and after the show with them.</p>
      
        <p>And it's it's it's us against the rest of the society because they don't like pornography.</p>
      
        <p>As many as guys say wonderful things like it's cool to have sex with somebody as a male performer for females.</p>
      
        <p>Very, very tough, isn't it?</p>
      
        <p>Because when you get older, their process of getting marriage is difficult.</p>
      
        <p>Not impossible, but difficult.</p>
      
        <p>And when you get older and once you lose your looks and stuff, you know, it's it's it's a tough.</p>
      
        <p>These are people that really care for.</p>
      
        <p>So maybe there's no love involved.</p>
