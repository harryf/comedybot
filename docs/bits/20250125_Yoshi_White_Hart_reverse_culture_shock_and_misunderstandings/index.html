        <p>For two weeks.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I'm not a zoologist.</p>
      
        <p>That's not cool.</p>
      
        <p>And, uh, I'm not a zoologist.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a zoologist.</p>
      
        <p>But I'm a zoologist.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm a zoologist.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a zoologist.</p>
      
        <p>So, um, so I went back to the podcast, and please, we found a cat.</p>
      
        <p>Could you, could you not send me the pictures any more?</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>And I, I don't know, I don't know what it, there's something about my personality, you</p>
      
        <p>know.</p>
      
        <p>Like, growing up, um, you'll figure out later on, but like, um, people always show me their</p>
      
        <p>dicks for some reason.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>So this particular guy, I don't know, you know.</p>
      
        <p>He's like, oh, I'm sorry.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know, you know, he'll always send me his dick pictures on national holidays.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, okay, Halloween's not a national holiday, but he'll put a picture of like a,</p>
      
        <p>he'll put a pumpkin on top of his head and take a picture of that.</p>
      
        <p>He'll put an outfit on his dick on Christmas, you know, like a Santa Claus outfit.</p>
      
        <p>And you know, not cool, but he'll take a picture of 9-11 and he'll put NYPD blue helmet on.</p>
      
        <p>Of course I would do the same to English people, but like you fucking salute that dick. So anyway,</p>
      
        <p>yeah, weird. So there's obviously something about me and I think a lot of times,</p>
      
        <p>it's more like my misunderstanding situation or a very uncomfortable situation, right?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if you know this, here's a good example when I'm having a problem with my family.</p>
      
        <p>You know this thing called reverse culture shock? Like I was born in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>live in the West so long, when I go back, you know, I'm more westernized. So like,</p>
      
        <p>I'm kind of like, you know, like a IBM PC computer, but my operating system is like Apple now.</p>
      
        <p>So when I go back to Japan, like, I'm confused, like,</p>
      
        <p>I have to explain to them, but they don't believe me, like early 70s in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>there was a group of Americans living in Japan. They want to celebrate Christmas,</p>
      
        <p>and they want to eat turkeys, and turkeys are not indigenous animal of Japan. So all those</p>
      
        <p>Americans ate chicken for Christmas when the Japanese people thought, oh, I guess that's what</p>
      
        <p>you're supposed to do. Around the same time, KFC was expanding their franchise in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>and I didn't know that. You know what I mean? I was going to go to their franchise in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>and I was like, I don't even know if I'm going to go to their franchise in Japan. I'm going to go there.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm like, you know what? I'm going to go there. And I'm like, I'm going to go there. And I'm going to go to their franchise in Japan.</p>
      
        <p>And, I don't know if you know this, every KFC in Japan have life-size statue of Colonel Sanders.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why, but they just have them like that?</p>
      
        <p>Well, that year, some joker put Santa Claus outfit on Colonel Sanders.</p>
      
        <p>So a lot of Japanese people think KFC and Colonel Sanders have something to do with Christmas.</p>
      
        <p>So every Christmas in Japan, if you want to eat KFC for Christmas, you have to make a reservation like three months ahead.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, here's the weird part. I have to explain what's going on.</p>
      
        <p>And this makes me really uncomfortable because I don't want to disrespect religious people.</p>
      
        <p>So quite often times, they will crucify Colonel Sanders on the cross.</p>
      
        <p>I shouldn't be laughing, but they put a nail on Colonel Sanders.</p>
      
        <p>You don't see blood, you see gravy.</p>
      
        <p>Or another time, they've crucified Santa Claus, right?</p>
      
        <p>So why am I the representative of Christianity?</p>
      
        <p>Can you not crucify Santa Claus, Colonel Sanders?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, that's uncomfortable.</p>
      
        <p>So pretty much, that's the kind of stuff I have to deal with.</p>
      
        <p>I was born in eastern part of Japan.</p>
      
        <p>And do you guys remember about 2011, there was earthquake, tsunami.</p>
      
        <p>It just devastated eastern part of Japan.</p>
      
        <p>And thank God all my family survived.</p>
      
        <p>But it was so powerful, the wave hitting eastern part of Japan.</p>
      
        <p>Many of the building parts, you know, buildings, cars, and ships, all this debris, flowed away from Japan.</p>
      
        <p>In fact, many of this debris flowed across Pacific Ocean.</p>
      
        <p>And it was a big expansion at western United States.</p>
      
        <p>You know, it took sometimes 2, 3, 4, 5, sometimes even 6, 7 years, to hit the western part of Japan.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of incredible, all this debris crossing the Pacific Ocean, hit Japan.</p>
      
        <p>Hit California, Oregon, Washington.</p>
      
        <p>I'm telling you because I finally saw my grandmother last week.</p>
      
        <p>And...</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, I think that's really funny, but I'll get rid of it.</p>
      
        <p>That's what comedy is.</p>
      
        <p>You know what's interesting?</p>
      
        <p>When people...</p>
      
        <p>I apologize, it's not funny.</p>
      
        <p>But when they have found bloated people after the tsunami, they get really large, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I should be delicate about it, but they get so large, they look like whales at the beach.</p>
      
        <p>You know, when the whales are stuck.</p>
      
        <p>I know I would have the answer, but the Japanese have a very complicated route.</p>
      
        <p>They're like, what's the relationship? Whales?</p>
      
        <p>We...</p>
      
        <p>Sorry.</p>
      
        <p>I think only Norwegian Japanese people, we...whales, you know?</p>
      
        <p>By the way, did you know that we're Godzilla?</p>
      
        <p>It's a Japanese word, Gojira.</p>
      
        <p>Which is a combination word...</p>
      
        <p>Gorilla and Kujira, which is whale.</p>
      
        <p>So Godzilla is basically water breathing whales.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, it's useless information.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway...</p>
      
        <p>But when my American friends found out that I eat whales, they get really, really upset.</p>
      
        <p>Because, you know, I think just like UK, they're very environmentally friendly and Japanese are not.</p>
      
        <p>I just want to make clear to my American friends.</p>
      
        <p>So let me get this straight.</p>
      
        <p>In America, it's not okay to eat whales, but it's okay to look like one.</p>
      
        <p>By the way, like 40% of Americans are obese and Japan is about 3 to 4%, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>We can't...we're, I guess, healthier.</p>
