        <p>It's that kind of experience growing up</p>
      
        <p>kind of put me</p>
      
        <p>in a path like</p>
      
        <p>in sex world, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And I don't want</p>
      
        <p>to say like,</p>
      
        <p>it's all crude and dark, you know, because you do</p>
      
        <p>find a lot of amazing people in sex</p>
      
        <p>world, but I think I particularly remember</p>
      
        <p>first time</p>
      
        <p>I saw pornography,</p>
      
        <p>my parents were fighting, and</p>
      
        <p>it's really bad, because my dad, my mom</p>
      
        <p>didn't want to marry my mom.</p>
      
        <p>She was kind of forced, it's like a arranged marriage,</p>
      
        <p>so she was very resentful, so every time she used to</p>
      
        <p>see my face, my face kind of reminded</p>
      
        <p>her unhappiness, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>You know what's so interesting?</p>
      
        <p>I didn't expect laughter in that part.</p>
      
        <p>Because most Americans feel bad for me,</p>
      
        <p>but other guys...</p>
      
        <p>That's a new one, okay.</p>
      
        <p>I wasn't trying to be funny, but okay.</p>
      
        <p>So she was very unhappy</p>
      
        <p>with my dad, you know,</p>
      
        <p>doesn't like me, it's not fun knowing</p>
      
        <p>that your, you know,</p>
      
        <p>parents are having problems, you don't know why, but like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, the reality was she was very unhappy</p>
      
        <p>and she wasn't happy to see me.</p>
      
        <p>But I remember one time</p>
      
        <p>particularly,</p>
      
        <p>particularly</p>
      
        <p>they were fighting, right? Like, I don't like,</p>
      
        <p>I don't, I hate this shit where</p>
      
        <p>I don't know how it was</p>
      
        <p>for you guys, but my parents always fight</p>
      
        <p>in the middle of the night, and like, you know, you wake up in the middle of the night</p>
      
        <p>people scream, it is scary when you're a young kid.</p>
      
        <p>So my brother went up</p>
      
        <p>and tried to help my parents stop fighting,</p>
      
        <p>I, you know, I just ran downstairs.</p>
      
        <p>And this one I remember because</p>
      
        <p>I was so afraid of</p>
      
        <p>what's going on upstairs,</p>
      
        <p>interesting that I went to the library</p>
      
        <p>with books like this,</p>
      
        <p>and my dad always had those huge books, you know,</p>
      
        <p>so I don't know why,</p>
      
        <p>I start pawning them up, you know, put one</p>
      
        <p>this way and put another one, I'm trying to make a</p>
      
        <p>little castle, right? Like, so</p>
      
        <p>someplace I could hide, you know?</p>
      
        <p>And then I ran out of a couple books</p>
      
        <p>and I need a couple more to,</p>
      
        <p>when I go in to cover and hide,</p>
      
        <p>and</p>
      
        <p>I noticed there's two books in the corner</p>
      
        <p>and I ran out, I've never</p>
      
        <p>noticed the books, so I got them</p>
      
        <p>and these are like, I guess,</p>
      
        <p>they're not exactly pornographic,</p>
      
        <p>they're very tasty nude pictures</p>
      
        <p>and pornography,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know, maybe some of you are old enough</p>
      
        <p>to remember, do you remember that they, when they had</p>
      
        <p>a porn magazine, they would put a star</p>
      
        <p>on the genitalia?</p>
      
        <p>Yes. Okay, so I'm like, okay,</p>
      
        <p>see, everyone in these</p>
      
        <p>books were like, Caucasian</p>
      
        <p>people, I've never seen them, and growing up in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>I just thought everyone's Asian,</p>
      
        <p>like Caucasian black people</p>
      
        <p>not real, like I</p>
      
        <p>didn't think they exist, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like you guys existed the way Godzilla</p>
      
        <p>existed, in my thinking.</p>
      
        <p>So I was, I'm seeing these</p>
      
        <p>people naked as they start, and this is what I thought,</p>
      
        <p>I thought white people had permanent stars</p>
      
        <p>over them.</p>
      
        <p>Obviously it was to cover, but</p>
      
        <p>I thought you guys were</p>
      
        <p>aliens because you had a star over your thing,</p>
      
        <p>star here, so I'm like, what a</p>
      
        <p>strange group of people, and</p>
      
        <p>but this is what</p>
      
        <p>really changed me,</p>
      
        <p>and the reason why I feel so sympathetic,</p>
      
        <p>to this pornography,</p>
      
        <p>I saw these people having sex,</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know what that was at the time,</p>
      
        <p>but I saw them having sex,</p>
      
        <p>and I thought,</p>
      
        <p>they're kissing each other, and hugging</p>
      
        <p>each other, something I never saw my parents</p>
      
        <p>do, so</p>
      
        <p>I thought, I don't know what this is,</p>
      
        <p>I think this is an amazing</p>
      
        <p>and wonderful thing. So growing</p>
      
        <p>up, pornography, for me,</p>
      
        <p>it wasn't like, you know,</p>
      
        <p>a terrible thing, you know, so</p>
      
        <p>I think because I had a</p>
      
        <p>favorable impression of pornography,</p>
      
        <p>I was</p>
      
        <p>kind of friendly to it, and I grew up in</p>
      
        <p>a semi-red light district,</p>
      
        <p>so</p>
