    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>Because, you know, you've got to remember, this is like late 90s.</p>
      
        <p>It's not like people go online, Reddit or something, and ask for help.</p>
      
        <p>There wasn't a whole lot.</p>
      
        <p>So you have to go to a porn shop, and especially in small towns,</p>
      
        <p>porn shops are really like embassy.</p>
      
        <p>In small towns, especially like gay kids.</p>
      
        <p>Because there's really not a place to go.</p>
      
        <p>You're always not able to trust people.</p>
      
        <p>So young gay kids, everyday kids are turning 18.</p>
      
        <p>And imagine you come from a community, you can't talk about this thing.</p>
      
        <p>You need help.</p>
      
        <p>And you want to talk to somebody without them making you feel bad.</p>
      
        <p>And sadly, for a long time, this is absolutely true,</p>
      
        <p>the places for gay young people to meet is porn shops,</p>
      
        <p>if they don't have gay bars.</p>
      
        <p>Because it can be very dangerous.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm cognitive about that.</p>
      
        <p>So I want to be a bit more sensitive.</p>
      
        <p>I remember this kid walking,</p>
      
        <p>Sir, could you help me find really good gay porn?</p>
      
        <p>Here's the thing.</p>
      
        <p>I don't watch gay porn, but I read just enough reviews.</p>
      
        <p>Because you don't want to say,</p>
      
        <p>Oh, this fucking suit, who watches that?</p>
      
        <p>You know, you don't want to do that.</p>
      
        <p>So I read reviews.</p>
      
        <p>So I said, well, I highly recommend these brands.</p>
      
        <p>There's Balcom, Mustin, Bellamy.</p>
      
        <p>These are top of the line.</p>
      
        <p>In fact, this one, Jeff Strakker,</p>
      
        <p>Jeff Strakker.</p>
      
        <p>He just won ABN Gay Award.</p>
      
        <p>He got, on this one, he got five dicks out of five dicks.</p>
      
        <p>So I highly recommend this one.</p>
      
        <p>Now, if you like chunky guys, bears,</p>
      
        <p>I recommend this one.</p>
      
        <p>You know, so like, you know, you get a movie,</p>
      
        <p>you don't want to make them feel bad, right?</p>
      
        <p>This is how different the kids are 25 years ago.</p>
      
        <p>So this kid, very nice, thankful.</p>
      
        <p>He returned next day, the tape, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I'm sure you guys say sushi before, right?</p>
      
        <p>Obviously.</p>
      
        <p>And you know that little ginger shit in his eye?</p>
      
        <p>That's, you know, the reason you have that is because</p>
      
        <p>every time you have a savoriness,</p>
      
        <p>you want to try and make sushi,</p>
      
        <p>you take that little radish thing,</p>
      
        <p>kind of wipe out, cleanse it, enjoy the next sushi.</p>
      
        <p>Well, he did a typical thing where I think he felt guilty.</p>
      
        <p>He was guilty that he watched gay porn.</p>
      
        <p>So what he did was he brought,</p>
      
        <p>he tried to read four heterosexual tapes</p>
      
        <p>to cleanse the gayness from that night before.</p>
      
        <p>And don't get me wrong, I make commissions, I'm okay,</p>
      
        <p>but I told him like, look, if you really want to watch this,</p>
      
        <p>that's fine, but you should feel guilty.</p>
      
        <p>Because, you know, when you grow up in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>we don't have this thing where like,</p>
      
        <p>Judeo-Christian where you should be ashamed gay.</p>
      
        <p>We don't, you know, I mean, we think it's silly.</p>
      
        <p>But it's not shameful, you know.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you're not supposed to put that there, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know what he told me?</p>
      
        <p>I just don't want my parents to think I'm gay</p>
      
        <p>because they think they didn't raise me right.</p>
      
        <p>And I told him like, no, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>If anything, you conduct yourself in such a polite, wonderful manner.</p>
      
        <p>I think your parents did well.</p>
      
        <p>And you shouldn't feel guilty about this.</p>
      
        <p>This is who you are.</p>
      
        <p>You're going to meet plenty of people in your life</p>
      
        <p>who's going to love you.</p>
      
        <p>And I think it's okay.</p>
