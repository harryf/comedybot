        <p>Very funny joke in China.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>Because it was a girl.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>Wow.</p>
      
        <p>You guys get that joke.</p>
      
        <p>Good.</p>
      
        <p>So, start from my.</p>
      
        <p>You're not deaf.</p>
      
        <p>He keeps saying wow, because you know me.</p>
      
        <p>He's going to get, you know, my jokes are just terrible.</p>
      
        <p>Now, so I should start from my.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm going to start with my childhood.</p>
      
        <p>So, I don't know if you know this.</p>
      
        <p>Homes in Japan are so small, you have to go public bath sometimes.</p>
      
        <p>You give a little bit of money, you take a shower.</p>
      
        <p>So, you could go with your dad or mom.</p>
      
        <p>And I remember when I was five years old, my dad took me to a public bath where all the men's are.</p>
      
        <p>And because I'm so short, as soon as I walk in, because they're men, I'm at the dick level, right?</p>
      
        <p>Because I'm short.</p>
      
        <p>So, all the dicks are coming at me like this.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm like, that didn't bother me.</p>
      
        <p>You know what bothered me?</p>
      
        <p>There was a man covered in tattoo completely.</p>
      
        <p>There's only one group in Japan is completely in tattoo.</p>
      
        <p>They're Yakuza, which is Japanese for Yakuza, which is eight, nine, and three, which makes 20.</p>
      
        <p>And 20 is a worthless number in gambling.</p>
      
        <p>Hence, they're considered as worthless member of society.</p>
      
        <p>They're criminals, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, I've seen tattoo before, but this particular guy had another weird thing.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if you noticed, in Japan, when you spend one year in prison, you get one pearl.</p>
      
        <p>What do you do with it?</p>
      
        <p>You cut the side of your penis and put your pearl in there.</p>
      
        <p>So if you do 15 years, you have 15 pearls.</p>
      
        <p>For two reasons.</p>
      
        <p>It's like resume, like show everyone, I did some hard time.</p>
      
        <p>But two, ladies like, it's like a French tickler.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, you know, you have a bum chino.</p>
      
        <p>Or maybe if you're a gay man, you like, you know, bum chino, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, sir, you see this.</p>
      
        <p>You're a gay man.</p>
      
        <p>You seem to have a big dick energy, right?</p>
      
        <p>You have a good one.</p>
      
        <p>Just like Rocco.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm five, right?</p>
      
        <p>I thought he was sick.</p>
      
        <p>I thought there was something wrong with his penis.</p>
      
        <p>So I walked to him and I touched his penis.</p>
      
        <p>I'm trying to push the marble out of his penis.</p>
      
        <p>Like I'm touching like this.</p>
      
        <p>Are you okay, right?</p>
      
        <p>He's not happy with me because no man wants to have anybody touching his penis except</p>
      
        <p>for a woman.</p>
      
        <p>So he said, .</p>
      
        <p>I said, .</p>
      
        <p>What are you doing, goddamn kid?</p>
      
        <p>Then he said, .</p>
      
        <p>Which is, what's your goddamn father?</p>
      
        <p>I said, oh, my dad's over there.</p>
      
        <p>That fucking piece of shit.</p>
      
        <p>Soon as I put him in, he ran out of the bath naked.</p>
      
        <p>He just ran out.</p>
      
        <p>He just abandoned me because these mafia guys would beat those people up.</p>
      
        <p>Now, why am I telling you this?</p>
      
        <p>Because there are many sad situations when adults are molesting kids.</p>
      
        <p>But this is one of those weird situations when a child is molesting an adult.</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>I'm the original child molester.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm just a weird kid doing that kind of stuff.</p>
      
        <p>And now, I love this fantasy quote because my parents never got along.</p>
      
        <p>Because my mother and my father both have fantasy that's not compatible.</p>
      
        <p>For example, my mother wanted to be an upper class, fancy lady like Princess Diana.</p>
      
        <p>My dad just wanted to have a traditional Japanese wife.</p>
      
        <p>But these are two fantasies, it's not going to be compatible.</p>
      
        <p>So they're always fighting.</p>
      
        <p>And then, I had a friend who was a Japanese.</p>
      
        <p>And I was like, .</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to have to get a Japanese wife.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to have a Japanese wife.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to have to get a Japanese wife.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm like, .</p>
