        <p>But I would like to address, I did a show here, what was it, two weeks ago?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, so we did a show.</p>
      
        <p>Response was good.</p>
      
        <p>Somebody asked me after the show, Yoshi, do you hate women?</p>
      
        <p>Or, because you work in porn business, did you learn to hate women?</p>
      
        <p>The answer is no.</p>
      
        <p>But I do have a complicated relationship with women.</p>
      
        <p>And when I say complicated, I'm talking about my mother.</p>
      
        <p>And here's a kind of common experience with my mom.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think I was like five or six years old.</p>
      
        <p>I'm sure, is English your first language?</p>
      
        <p>For most of you?</p>
      
        <p>Arabic is my first language.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>So, you guys are, this is an incredible global place.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm sure you know about chicken pox, right?</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>So, I was five or six, maybe seven, I was six.</p>
      
        <p>And my body is completely covered in chicken pox.</p>
      
        <p>And I should just stay home.</p>
      
        <p>But some reason my mom decided to drag me out of the house.</p>
      
        <p>A couple blocks away in this very small aisle with a bunch of stores on both sides.</p>
      
        <p>You know, Japan is a very small place.</p>
      
        <p>And I don't understand why she's dragging me.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really, really sick.</p>
      
        <p>And all of a sudden, I see my mom's four friends.</p>
      
        <p>And they're saying something.</p>
      
        <p>And basically, my mom's explaining to them, I have chicken pox.</p>
      
        <p>And you know what she does?</p>
      
        <p>They all look at me and my mother pulled my pants down, showed my little cock with chicken pox all over.</p>
      
        <p>And they started laughing, right?</p>
      
        <p>And Harry, here's the thing.</p>
      
        <p>That was the first time a lady started laughing at my little cock.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my God.</p>
      
        <p>But believe me, that wasn't the last time.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm confused because I'm just a kid in Osaka.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, so, you know, I live in a taishoku, which is a ghetto.</p>
      
        <p>It really is a ghetto.</p>
      
        <p>So they start laughing.</p>
      
        <p>About a minute, they turn around and just walk away and just leave me there.</p>
      
        <p>So I have my pants down.</p>
      
        <p>So I start walking like a penguin just chasing after my mom.</p>
      
        <p>Because, you know, I'm not looking with my mom.</p>
      
        <p>And, of course, I trip.</p>
      
        <p>And it's always been like that.</p>
      
        <p>My mother was basically forced to marry my dad.</p>
      
        <p>So anytime she has a free time to spend time with her friends, she just completely abandoned me and just leave.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, that's pretty indicative when I was a kid, you know, chasing after people that wasn't willing to give me affection.</p>
      
        <p>So I don't hate women, but I never really learned to make a connection with women very well.</p>
