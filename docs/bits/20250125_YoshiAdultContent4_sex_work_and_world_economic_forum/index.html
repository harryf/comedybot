        <p>Can you imagine? Taliban runs</p>
      
        <p>fucking Afghanistan,</p>
      
        <p>I found, when do you find</p>
      
        <p>hookers in Afghanistan? You go to</p>
      
        <p>Chinese restaurants.</p>
      
        <p>True story. There's all the hookers who work there,</p>
      
        <p>because they're not Muslims.</p>
      
        <p>There's hookers there, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, any, so, you know,</p>
      
        <p>you guys know Anthony Bourdain?</p>
      
        <p>Yes. Okay, I'm on season one, episode two,</p>
      
        <p>the K-town episode, I mean, there,</p>
      
        <p>and I made him laugh because, Mr. Bourdain,</p>
      
        <p>I'm gonna be the Anthony Bourdain of sex.</p>
      
        <p>Which is kind of true, because</p>
      
        <p>I've been traveling</p>
      
        <p>anything sex related.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>I went to Greece,</p>
      
        <p>and they were, uh, there's,</p>
      
        <p>my friend was doing, like, a refugee camp,</p>
      
        <p>so my friend was helping, like, a lot of</p>
      
        <p>Syrian, uh, Palestinian,</p>
      
        <p>Afghan, and other, um,</p>
      
        <p>refugee camp in Athens.</p>
      
        <p>So he said, why don't you come and visit?</p>
      
        <p>So I went three days. What a bummer, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, I'm, I wanna help</p>
      
        <p>them, but, like, I didn't,</p>
      
        <p>I didn't feel good. So,</p>
      
        <p>I checked if there's a red light district</p>
      
        <p>in Athens. I'll be honest with you.</p>
      
        <p>So I found it,</p>
      
        <p>and there's a red light district in Athens,</p>
      
        <p>and if you go to this</p>
      
        <p>brothels, and if you see a girl that you like,</p>
      
        <p>you pay them, old lady,</p>
      
        <p>you stay in the room, and you wait</p>
      
        <p>your turn, and if the girl's popular, you gotta wait</p>
      
        <p>for a while, right? So what they do is,</p>
      
        <p>for you to not get frustrated and angry,</p>
      
        <p>each one of those rooms have</p>
      
        <p>TV playing porn.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Do you realize how uncomfortable</p>
      
        <p>it is for me,</p>
      
        <p>sitting there waiting for a girl,</p>
      
        <p>and watching porn, the movie</p>
      
        <p>I worked on,</p>
      
        <p>on the monitor, right? It's really embarrassing, because</p>
      
        <p>it's one of the first ones where I could see</p>
      
        <p>all the mistakes I made.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really embarrassed. I'll be honest, I didn't,</p>
      
        <p>I did a good job.</p>
      
        <p>It's a little embarrassing.</p>
      
        <p>It's really embarrassing.</p>
      
        <p>And another embarrassing thing is</p>
      
        <p>when I started seeing my friends fucking.</p>
      
        <p>Because, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I know they act like</p>
      
        <p>studs or whores, but</p>
      
        <p>behind the scenes, this just worked for them.</p>
      
        <p>They have to support, they're taking</p>
      
        <p>care of their family. Whether you like it or not,</p>
      
        <p>you don't respect them, I'm just saying these are</p>
      
        <p>my friends fucking. It's a little</p>
      
        <p>uncomfortable, but it was</p>
      
        <p>really, really uncomfortable there, because</p>
      
        <p>as I'm looking, there's my friend</p>
      
        <p>Brandon Iron, he's Canadian, a good friend of mine,</p>
      
        <p>and I'm, I see</p>
      
        <p>him, it's a</p>
      
        <p>movie called Slap Happy.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>every time he has sex with a girl, after he slapped</p>
      
        <p>the girl in the face. I don't condone it,</p>
      
        <p>but that's the movie that he made,</p>
      
        <p>you know?</p>
      
        <p>And I'll be honest, it made me really uncomfortable,</p>
      
        <p>because it was the first time I see Brandon</p>
      
        <p>because</p>
      
        <p>three months before that, he killed himself.</p>
      
        <p>So he's</p>
      
        <p>you know, he's my friend, and</p>
      
        <p>and, um, you know,</p>
      
        <p>and any time I watch porn,</p>
      
        <p>I'm at the point where it's hard for me to watch porn</p>
      
        <p>because a lot of them disappear</p>
      
        <p>or they're dead. You know, for you guys, you guys</p>
      
        <p>are civilians.</p>
      
        <p>Right, civilians?</p>
      
        <p>But I believe in the world,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I know too much information what happened</p>
      
        <p>to them. When a girl</p>
      
        <p>disappeared because she wanted to start</p>
      
        <p>her life, I'm okay with that.</p>
      
        <p>I hope you're, if you can't, you know where a lot of</p>
      
        <p>porn girls move to restart their life.</p>
      
        <p>Salt Lake City.</p>
      
        <p>Because Salt Lake City is kind of like</p>
      
        <p>religious Switzerland.</p>
      
        <p>There's a lot of discrimination.</p>
      
        <p>Mormons will</p>
      
        <p>not say, hey, you're in porn.</p>
      
        <p>They're not gonna say that. Because saying that</p>
      
        <p>that means they watch porn. They can't never admit that.</p>
      
        <p>So a lot of porn</p>
      
        <p>girls move to Salt Lake City.</p>
      
        <p>They know that you know that they</p>
      
        <p>did porn, but nobody say anything.</p>
      
        <p>So there's a big porn</p>
      
        <p>neutrality in Salt Lake City.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So that's okay. Like, you wanna restart?</p>
      
        <p>But the one that bothers me when they</p>
      
        <p>disappear because they're fucking dead or something.</p>
      
        <p>You know, these are my friends. So,</p>
      
        <p>I'll be honest.</p>
      
        <p>When I saw Brandon, I didn't even know.</p>
      
        <p>I started crying.</p>
      
        <p>Because he was the first friend I made</p>
      
        <p>and I've known him for 20 years since</p>
      
        <p>1999. And</p>
      
        <p>last thing any prostitute</p>
      
        <p>wanna see is walking in the room, the guy's</p>
      
        <p>crying. You know.</p>
      
        <p>So she took me out and I got to</p>
      
        <p>know them. So last</p>
      
        <p>six years, they be</p>
      
        <p>I go to Athens</p>
      
        <p>like three, four times a year. Not because</p>
      
        <p>hookers. I don't do that anymore. But I go there</p>
      
        <p>because I became friends with like five or six</p>
      
        <p>different brothels. So I bring</p>
      
        <p>money, candy, toys</p>
      
        <p>for the kids and stuff like that, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, like I'm like the</p>
      
        <p>Asian Santa Claus.</p>
      
        <p>Slanty Claus.</p>
      
        <p>So they</p>
      
        <p>became like family. Because one thing about</p>
      
        <p>sex workers, they never judge you. They really</p>
      
        <p>accept you. They treat you like a family member.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm very lucky</p>
      
        <p>because my mom said</p>
      
        <p>she wanna kill herself.</p>
      
        <p>When they see my face.</p>
      
        <p>It's really nice. I could go to a place.</p>
      
        <p>They're kinda happy to see me.</p>
      
        <p>Isn't it? Isn't it nice?</p>
      
        <p>We all have a place.</p>
      
        <p>I hope every one of us have a place. But I hope</p>
      
        <p>all of us have</p>
      
        <p>a place where we could go</p>
      
        <p>and be loved, right?</p>
      
        <p>I hope. I hope.</p>
      
        <p>I hope for everyone.</p>
      
        <p>So that's my place.</p>
      
        <p>And the reason I'm telling you, and I'll be done quick.</p>
      
        <p>I think</p>
      
        <p>the reason why</p>
      
        <p>there's a lot of</p>
      
        <p>terrible things happening in the world</p>
      
        <p>because there are people like this week</p>
      
        <p>in Switzerland, Davos,</p>
      
        <p>many rich and powerful people show up in Davos</p>
      
        <p>for World Economic Forum, right?</p>
      
        <p>I went two years ago.</p>
      
        <p>You know, I'm a whore whisperer.</p>
      
        <p>Soon as I went to Davos,</p>
      
        <p>right away, like, oh, she's a prostitute.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like, right away,</p>
      
        <p>I could tell. I could just smell it.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>Right? Ladies, you know what I mean.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean. Like, ladies,</p>
      
        <p>I know ladies, I know some of you,</p>
      
        <p>you could tell right away who's got a big dick.</p>
      
        <p>Right? You could kinda tell.</p>
      
        <p>Like, what?</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I noticed, like, guys</p>
      
        <p>good at dancing, that's always</p>
      
        <p>a good sign for ladies. You know, ladies,</p>
      
        <p>when you ride horses, you know,</p>
      
        <p>you have a certain rhythm, and guys who could dance,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean? There's a certain, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I can't dance shit, you know? So, like,</p>
      
        <p>I'm not popular, but you could tell right away</p>
      
        <p>who has this, like, sexual energy</p>
      
        <p>and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>When I went to World Economic Forum,</p>
      
        <p>this is what I learned over the years,</p>
      
        <p>because, um,</p>
      
        <p>rich people that doesn't have</p>
      
        <p>happy sex life,</p>
      
        <p>they don't have orgasm,</p>
      
        <p>you know what they do? These rich people?</p>
      
        <p>They fuck the poor.</p>
      
        <p>I listened.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm talking about, sir?</p>
      
        <p>Rich people get out fucking the poor people,</p>
      
        <p>right? Like, why?</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, I don't mean this, but,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean? Like, the way these guys think,</p>
      
        <p>why rape one girl when you could</p>
      
        <p>fire 10,000 people from your company?</p>
      
        <p>You just rape 10,000 people</p>
      
        <p>plus their fucking family. You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying? You understand.</p>
      
        <p>So, they get off and fucking,</p>
      
        <p>that's why</p>
      
        <p>these rich people,</p>
      
        <p>because the reason I meet a lot of,</p>
      
        <p>when you work with a lot of sex workers, porn stars,</p>
      
        <p>you meet a lot of rich and famous people.</p>
      
        <p>I used to deliver porn to</p>
      
        <p>Tonight Show with Jay Leno,</p>
      
        <p>because one of my friends got on the show</p>
      
        <p>on Jay Leno night, 2007,</p>
      
        <p>and when my friend Jim</p>
      
        <p>told the producer of the show,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi works in porn, so anytime there's</p>
      
        <p>famous Hollywood star or somebody famous on</p>
      
        <p>Tonight Show, they mention porn,</p>
      
        <p>they call me and I bring box of porn</p>
      
        <p>for famous people at Tonight Show.</p>
      
        <p>So, the people on my Facebook, I have</p>
      
        <p>pictures of famous people like Seth Rogen,</p>
      
        <p>who loves porn, and</p>
      
        <p>he's like, hey honey, he told his wife</p>
      
        <p>about porn. So,</p>
      
        <p>through sex workers at Tonight Show,</p>
      
        <p>I met so many fucking rich and powerful people.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I can't tell them their names,</p>
      
        <p>because, you know, the people who introduced me</p>
      
        <p>are going to get in trouble, but,</p>
      
        <p>that's the thing, like,</p>
      
        <p>they, they</p>
      
        <p>they fuck over people</p>
      
        <p>and they get off on that, you know.</p>
      
        <p>This is something that's really surprising to me.</p>
      
        <p>Because back then I thought, okay, they make a tough</p>
      
        <p>decision financially for company,</p>
      
        <p>for better economy, no, no, sometimes they really</p>
      
        <p>want to, they don't have to fire people,</p>
      
        <p>but they get off on fucking,</p>
      
        <p>you know, just,</p>
      
        <p>little before Christmas, fire them, they're being,</p>
      
        <p>oh my god, they get bonered, right?</p>
      
        <p>They just get so hard, like,</p>
      
        <p>just, they couldn't wait</p>
      
        <p>until January, no sir,</p>
      
        <p>fire them two days before Christmas,</p>
      
        <p>and just fuck them, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, so I met so many of them, right?</p>
      
        <p>And, and,</p>
      
        <p>here's the thing, I'll finish with this,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>you know Tom Wolfe, he's a very famous American writer?</p>
      
        <p>He had this phrase,</p>
      
        <p>very famous, he wrote like</p>
      
        <p>Rice Stuff, Bonfire Vanity,</p>
      
        <p>he coined the term</p>
      
        <p>Me Generation,</p>
      
        <p>direct, you know, he had this phrase,</p>
      
        <p>Masters of Universe.</p>
      
        <p>He meant like people in the 80s</p>
      
        <p>in America, Wall Street,</p>
      
        <p>they're so powerful, they make so much money,</p>
      
        <p>they get away with anything.</p>
      
        <p>Well these days, who are Masters of the Universe?</p>
      
        <p>These are, H-Pump</p>
      
        <p>manager, the billionaires,</p>
      
        <p>the head of the government,</p>
      
        <p>head of entertainment, military, academic,</p>
      
        <p>these are the most powerful people.</p>
      
        <p>They control everything.</p>
      
        <p>You know one thing</p>
      
        <p>they don't control?</p>
      
        <p>They can't control themselves.</p>
      
        <p>And when they're exposed,</p>
      
        <p>they usually have something to say, that's why</p>
      
        <p>they'll tell me like, you know this person</p>
      
        <p>that used to go to Obama, he's into kicking women in the head.</p>
      
        <p>What?</p>
      
        <p>True story, I'm not gonna tell who.</p>
      
        <p>This guy worked for Trump,</p>
      
        <p>he eats</p>
      
        <p>women's panties</p>
      
        <p>and shit like that, right?</p>
      
        <p>He's in the cabin.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean, like, when people used to rent</p>
      
        <p>porno from Tableau Video,</p>
      
        <p>like, oh my god, this guy used to be my</p>
      
        <p>ninth grade teacher.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know what I mean, it's like Matrix,</p>
      
        <p>I see the world so different now because,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean,</p>
      
        <p>once you know too much information,</p>
      
        <p>like, oh my god, this head of Microsoft</p>
      
        <p>is into getting punched in nuts.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know,</p>
      
        <p>I don't like that finish.</p>
      
        <p>That makes sense.</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>finally, um, so,</p>
      
        <p>do you guys know Jeffrey Epstein?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I know him.</p>
      
        <p>Luckily not personally.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, we know him.</p>
      
        <p>I've been to Airbus,</p>
      
        <p>I've been to every single Jeffrey Epstein's</p>
      
        <p>properties, and I was one of the</p>
      
        <p>four person in the courtroom</p>
      
        <p>because it was under COVID policy</p>
      
        <p>when I saw him getting,</p>
      
        <p>when his ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,</p>
      
        <p>getting guilty verdict,</p>
      
        <p>December 29, 2021.</p>
      
        <p>I was one of the four, and there's other</p>
      
        <p>four spot for journalists, so I was in that,</p>
      
        <p>I was there for sentencing,</p>
      
        <p>I went to Trump case, Harvey Weinstein,</p>
      
        <p>Danny Masterson, who used to be the</p>
      
        <p>70 show, he got convicted for rape,</p>
      
        <p>uh, S.B.F.,</p>
      
        <p>Elizabeth Holmes,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>I just got back from France for</p>
      
        <p>Gisele Petticoat's case.</p>
      
        <p>I went there for that</p>
      
        <p>conviction, so I</p>
      
        <p>I literally went out,</p>
      
        <p>I shouldn't have done it,</p>
      
        <p>I pat her shoulder, I shouldn't have touched her</p>
      
        <p>without permission, but</p>
      
        <p>I say, you know,</p>
      
        <p>Merci beaucoup, Madame, whatever,</p>
      
        <p>you know, because, he said that</p>
      
        <p>it was amazing, this lady, for those of you</p>
      
        <p>who don't know the case, her husband used to drug her</p>
      
        <p>and rape her with a bunch of other guys,</p>
      
        <p>and she could have done a private case</p>
      
        <p>where it would have been</p>
      
        <p>preventing any public, no, she said, no, no, no,</p>
      
        <p>let the whole, no, let the whole</p>
      
        <p>world show what happened to me.</p>
      
        <p>That lady walked every day</p>
      
        <p>for a hundred days, let the whole</p>
      
        <p>world see what happened to her.</p>
      
        <p>Her head's up, and she, she didn't</p>
      
        <p>even feel bad for her, she felt bad for her</p>
      
        <p>kids, but she went, and</p>
      
        <p>um, so she went in,</p>
      
        <p>and, did you know this?</p>
      
        <p>Her husband was</p>
      
        <p>arrested, and he was in jail,</p>
      
        <p>but the fifty other rapists,</p>
      
        <p>they have to walk into court every day.</p>
      
        <p>Did you know?</p>
      
        <p>I thought they got arrested, so every day, this</p>
      
        <p>fucking guy, they covered their</p>
      
        <p>faces like, you know, illegal Mexican</p>
      
        <p>migrant workers,</p>
      
        <p>Mexican illegal workers, that sounds</p>
      
        <p>redundant, but anyway, um,</p>
      
        <p>they're all illegal, bye bye, Trump.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, anyway, um,</p>
      
        <p>so I was shocked, like, oh my god,</p>
      
        <p>like, I told, I don't speak French,</p>
      
        <p>like, oh my god, are they the</p>
      
        <p>rapists? Like, oui oui, you know, like, um,</p>
      
        <p>I,</p>
      
        <p>there's fifty rapists walking into court</p>
      
        <p>every day, right? So you know what</p>
      
        <p>I did? Um, when I used to work</p>
      
        <p>at a video store, every time these</p>
      
        <p>fuckers are stealing stuff, or</p>
      
        <p>they're trying to sneak into the booth, watch,</p>
      
        <p>um, they cause a lot of</p>
      
        <p>problems, right? I don't know if you could see, but I have a, like,</p>
      
        <p>a, I bought a crack head,</p>
      
        <p>I got, uh, thirty stitches because</p>
      
        <p>I got in a fight with myself. He was</p>
      
        <p>shoplifting dildo. Anyway, um,</p>
      
        <p>so I got beaten up.</p>
      
        <p>So after that I learned, there's</p>
      
        <p>a special place in a porn</p>
      
        <p>shop where if I hit somebody</p>
      
        <p>with a baseball bat, because</p>
      
        <p>of the angle of the camera, they can't see me</p>
      
        <p>swinging bat, so whenever</p>
      
        <p>like I'm hiding corner and hit this</p>
      
        <p>motherfucker, you see sometimes</p>
      
        <p>crack head flying across the room for some</p>
      
        <p>reason.</p>
      
        <p>So I used to hit people all the time because I,</p>
      
        <p>you're not doing this shit again, motherfucker.</p>
      
        <p>So this</p>
      
        <p>is what I did. Soon as I look over the shoulder,</p>
      
        <p>I see the rapist coming over, so I just</p>
      
        <p>kind of timed it, so one time I went like,</p>
      
        <p>like that, right? So I</p>
      
        <p>elbowed that rapist in the face,</p>
      
        <p>and said like,</p>
      
        <p>and, uh, oh, I'm sorry,</p>
      
        <p>so I said, uh, you know, uh,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I don't speak French, so</p>
      
        <p>ching chong, whatever, and, um,</p>
      
        <p>the second guy, I just</p>
      
        <p>kind of elbow and hit him in the chest.</p>
      
        <p>Nobody's</p>
      
        <p>complaining. It's great, right?</p>
      
        <p>I mean,</p>
      
        <p>I'm hitting rapists, right?</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Here's a problem. Third</p>
      
        <p>one, I'm typing it, and as I'm</p>
      
        <p>swinging, I don't know what happened,</p>
      
        <p>but as this rapist coming, this lady</p>
      
        <p>caught front of him,</p>
      
        <p>front, front, so I'm thinking</p>
      
        <p>like, like that, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I hit this lady with</p>
      
        <p>big tits. I just</p>
      
        <p>elbowed, and, uh, you know,</p>
      
        <p>so I apologized, and I</p>
      
        <p>stopped, and my Japanese friends</p>
      
        <p>were like, well, why don't you be more careful, keep hitting</p>
      
        <p>those, can you imagine,</p>
      
        <p>miss, can you imagine for a second?</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>No, no,</p>
      
        <p>no, not, not the way, but can you imagine,</p>
      
        <p>I hit rapist one, two,</p>
      
        <p>third one, I hit the lady, right? But let's say</p>
      
        <p>on the fourth, and the fifth, and</p>
      
        <p>sixth, I missed the rapist,</p>
      
        <p>and all of a sudden, I just hit lady,</p>
      
        <p>like, number four lady, number</p>
      
        <p>five, like, all of a sudden, it looked like</p>
      
        <p>one, there was only one Asian</p>
      
        <p>guy there.</p>
      
        <p>Can you imagine, I hit number</p>
      
        <p>three, four, five, six lady,</p>
      
        <p>all of a sudden, you see this Asian guy just hitting women</p>
      
        <p>at the rape case, right?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not gonna do that!</p>
      
        <p>I'm not, so I, so I, I just</p>
      
        <p>stopped, right?</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>I'm, I'm going to, uh,</p>
      
        <p>uh, doubles tomorrow with Harry.</p>
      
        <p>Because I don't have a special pass, right?</p>
      
        <p>I don't have a special pass, and</p>
      
        <p>and I think it was hard</p>
      
        <p>to go into one of the hotels, because they're all</p>
      
        <p>fancy people, and you have to have credentials.</p>
      
        <p>You know how, you know how</p>
      
        <p>I get into hotels? Every time</p>
      
        <p>I see representatives of Japan,</p>
      
        <p>China, Korea, all those Asian people,</p>
      
        <p>I kind of sneak behind them, like I'm the</p>
      
        <p>part of the group.</p>
      
        <p>I just kind of, and if there's something</p>
      
        <p>in French or whatever,</p>
      
        <p>then I just walk in, right?</p>
      
        <p>But tomorrow I'm going with Harry, with a white guy.</p>
      
        <p>That, that looks legit.</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>so two minutes.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why I think</p>
      
        <p>we should have</p>
      
        <p>ethical pervers, like myself,</p>
      
        <p>kind of educating the public,</p>
      
        <p>because, because I</p>
      
        <p>think, um,</p>
      
        <p>when I was sitting in the room,</p>
      
        <p>uh, when they were, um,</p>
      
        <p>sentencing Glenn Maxwell,</p>
      
        <p>um, all the victims,</p>
      
        <p>it's a heartbreaker. All these girls,</p>
      
        <p>women now,</p>
      
        <p>victims' speech, right, like, they're just</p>
      
        <p>gonna tell the judge and the court</p>
      
        <p>how much impact this had in this.</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>they're in their 30s, 40s, even early 50s,</p>
      
        <p>but imagine 20, 30 years,</p>
      
        <p>they're just kids, right?</p>
      
        <p>And, uh, and even though they're older,</p>
      
        <p>in my head, I just see them as kids.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you just feel pain for these</p>
      
        <p>kids, you know, you just feel bad.</p>
      
        <p>And once they finish,</p>
      
        <p>uh, they're ready to have Glenn Maxwell,</p>
      
        <p>uh, sentencing her. You know what the defense</p>
      
        <p>said? Your Honor,</p>
      
        <p>Judge Nathan, Ms. Maxwell,</p>
      
        <p>she said, she would like to speak.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, we were all shocked because during the case,</p>
      
        <p>she never spoke one time.</p>
      
        <p>So she went up and spoke, right?</p>
      
        <p>I swear to God,</p>
      
        <p>it was really shocking.</p>
      
        <p>She spoke</p>
      
        <p>in that Cambridge,</p>
      
        <p>Oxford English.</p>
      
        <p>And this is a person</p>
      
        <p>who grew up in privilege.</p>
      
        <p>She literally grew up with kings and royal family.</p>
      
        <p>She's friends with Prince Andrew.</p>
      
        <p>She knew the president, all the billionaires.</p>
      
        <p>The way she spoke,</p>
      
        <p>imagine, like, a female version</p>
      
        <p>of Darth Vader.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean? Like, she,</p>
      
        <p>she, I'll be honest, she seduced me.</p>
      
        <p>Like,</p>
      
        <p>that, that voice.</p>
      
        <p>You know, I have Asian accent, it's not,</p>
      
        <p>it sounds funny, but</p>
      
        <p>when English people at the highest level speak</p>
      
        <p>in that language, my God,</p>
      
        <p>I mean, talk, my nipples</p>
      
        <p>are getting hard, right? So,</p>
      
        <p>so, when she spoke,</p>
      
        <p>I was like,</p>
      
        <p>I think maybe these kids are lying. That's how,</p>
      
        <p>that's how seductive, right?</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, imagine,</p>
      
        <p>you're 14, 15, 16 years</p>
      
        <p>old, right? You don't have a father.</p>
      
        <p>You come from poor neighborhood. You don't have</p>
      
        <p>any opportunity. You see this beautiful</p>
      
        <p>British lady with all that picture</p>
      
        <p>with famous people, she has all this money,</p>
      
        <p>access, and she's giving you</p>
      
        <p>and offering the whole world.</p>
      
        <p>Look, I was seduced. You think</p>
      
        <p>these girls have a chance?</p>
      
        <p>No fucking chance at all.</p>
      
        <p>You need people like me</p>
      
        <p>warning the public, like the danger of</p>
      
        <p>these kind of perverts, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like, I'm</p>
      
        <p>I'm kind of vaccinated to perversity.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm here to</p>
      
        <p>like Prometheus</p>
      
        <p>fired the torch</p>
      
        <p>of truth, right? So, I think you need</p>
      
        <p>people like me kind of</p>
      
        <p>save them.</p>
      
        <p>And last one is, do you guys</p>
      
        <p>know the story of Oedipus Rex?</p>
      
        <p>King Oedipus,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>his father was king,</p>
      
        <p>and the fortune teller</p>
      
        <p>say, hey,</p>
      
        <p>your kid's gonna raise up, and when he's an adult</p>
      
        <p>he's gonna kill you and marry</p>
      
        <p>your wife. So, king said, I need to</p>
      
        <p>kill my son. Well,</p>
      
        <p>his servant didn't kill this kid</p>
      
        <p>and put this kid away,</p>
      
        <p>and somebody else raised the</p>
      
        <p>kid. When that kid realized,</p>
      
        <p>when he got old, his foster</p>
      
        <p>parents told him, the reason I'm</p>
      
        <p>gonna have you because prophecy said</p>
      
        <p>you're gonna kill your father</p>
      
        <p>and marry your mom.</p>
      
        <p>So, he fled thinking that's their real</p>
      
        <p>parents, right? Well, what happens, eventually</p>
      
        <p>he meets his real father, they're gonna fight,</p>
      
        <p>he kills the father,</p>
      
        <p>marries his mom,</p>
      
        <p>he becomes motherfucker.</p>
      
        <p>The reason I'm telling</p>
      
        <p>you, when you go to Davos, these rich people,</p>
      
        <p>they're saying,</p>
      
        <p>sustainability.</p>
      
        <p>They're saying to Davos,</p>
      
        <p>we're here to make the world</p>
      
        <p>a better place. They don't</p>
      
        <p>realize these are the same people who created the</p>
      
        <p>problem to begin with. And like</p>
      
        <p>the motherfucker that they are, they don't</p>
      
        <p>know that they caused the problem.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>I have to put a mirror to their</p>
      
        <p>face and say, no, no, no, no, sir.</p>
      
        <p>You're the problem.</p>
      
        <p>And you know how do I know?</p>
      
        <p>Because it takes a pervert to know another pervert.</p>
      
        <p>Alright guys, thank you very much.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, I think we're too long.</p>
