        <p>Let me kick off with a question for Yoshi on this one.</p>
      
        <p>So you've worked in kind of like the whole aspect of the porn industry.</p>
      
        <p>If you have to think about which part you enjoyed the most, so from smuggling dirty</p>
      
        <p>magazines to selling porn to young gay boys to...</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Looking for the right moment to whack on a videotape, which part was the one that you</p>
      
        <p>actually enjoyed the most?</p>
      
        <p>Maybe I'm not answering your question, but I was in jail one time.</p>
      
        <p>Which side of the bars?</p>
      
        <p>September 11.</p>
      
        <p>Wait.</p>
      
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
      
        <p>2003.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>I was going up to Washington state because my cousin passed away and my dad passed away</p>
      
        <p>maybe a month before that.</p>
      
        <p>So I wasn't particularly in good mental state and I took the wrong bag.</p>
      
        <p>And remember when I stayed, I had a big circle because I bought a shoplift or whatever?</p>
      
        <p>So after that I got a collapsible baton, which is like a little stick when you go like this</p>
      
        <p>and become big.</p>
      
        <p>Well, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>Well, because I had to go to a funeral, I took a wrong bag.</p>
      
        <p>At LAX, they found the bag with that weapon.</p>
      
        <p>Weirdly, that was classified like a felony level kind of thing versus if I had a handgun,</p>
      
        <p>they would have been okay.</p>
      
        <p>It wouldn't have been misdemeanor.</p>
      
        <p>So I ended up going to jail for like five or six days.</p>
      
        <p>In LA County, right?</p>
      
        <p>And it's really bad.</p>
      
        <p>because all the blacks in one corner,</p>
      
        <p>all the whites,</p>
      
        <p>all the Latino,</p>
      
        <p>and you know,</p>
      
        <p>Asians really don't commit a lot of crime,</p>
      
        <p>so I'm in the corner with me</p>
      
        <p>and a guy in a women's outfit</p>
      
        <p>and a Samoan guy.</p>
      
        <p>So it was a really, really bad situation.</p>
      
        <p>Only reason I didn't get hurt</p>
      
        <p>because I was wearing a butt man t-shirt</p>
      
        <p>or belladonna t-shirt.</p>
      
        <p>I can't remember what I was wearing.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, one of the black guys said,</p>
      
        <p>hey, what did you get done?</p>
      
        <p>I work.</p>
      
        <p>As soon as they found out I work in porn,</p>
