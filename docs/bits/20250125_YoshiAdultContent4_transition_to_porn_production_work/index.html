        <p>in like a hostage situation, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>around 2003, I got sick and tired of</p>
      
        <p>work, uh, living in Washington State, I wanted to</p>
      
        <p>leave, and I went to the porn</p>
      
        <p>convention that year, and then</p>
      
        <p>uh, Evil Angel, the company,</p>
      
        <p>sorry, that's what I do,</p>
      
        <p>and um, I went to the</p>
      
        <p>porn convention, and Evil Angel,</p>
      
        <p>the biggest porn company, they're like the Microsoft</p>
      
        <p>porn, back in the day.</p>
      
        <p>So, that's where Rocco</p>
      
        <p>Saffredi worked and things like that, so, they</p>
      
        <p>had a sign that said, uh, DVD</p>
      
        <p>producer wanted.</p>
      
        <p>The only reason I got the job, because out of the</p>
      
        <p>40,000 visits at the convention that year,</p>
      
        <p>I was the only one applying for it.</p>
      
        <p>That is the only reason I got the job.</p>
      
        <p>So, I got</p>
      
        <p>the job, and, um, moved to LA,</p>
      
        <p>started working for Evil Angel,</p>
      
        <p>and, um, so,</p>
      
        <p>um, I work at a retail store,</p>
      
        <p>now I'm working for the production</p>
      
        <p>company, right, and when you work</p>
      
        <p>for porn companies, you learn</p>
      
        <p>a lot of interesting rules, right?</p>
      
        <p>And like, it's kind of</p>
      
        <p>weird.</p>
      
        <p>So, 2007, for those of you old enough</p>
      
        <p>to remember, was a very difficult</p>
      
        <p>year, 2007, 8, why?</p>
      
        <p>Couple reasons. Financial crisis, people</p>
      
        <p>losing their job, people don't have excess money</p>
      
        <p>to buy pornography, number two,</p>
      
        <p>um, invention</p>
      
        <p>of iPhone really hurt</p>
      
        <p>our business, because people started watching porn</p>
      
        <p>on iPhone, and three, PornHub</p>
      
        <p>also became prominent in 2007.</p>
      
        <p>So, those are like, um,</p>
      
        <p>Armageddon for porn people back then.</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>and the fourth horseman</p>
      
        <p>of Armageddon is like, U.S. government's</p>
      
        <p>always going after porn</p>
      
        <p>company. So, you know what boss</p>
      
        <p>thought? Yoshi, we need to start making</p>
      
        <p>new porn movie, or</p>
      
        <p>new porn product to sell</p>
      
        <p>to customers, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, my boss's bright idea,</p>
      
        <p>he said, we should start making fisting movies.</p>
      
        <p>That's his idea.</p>
      
        <p>Make fist, for those of you,</p>
      
        <p>uh, you don't know what fisting, you could probably</p>
      
        <p>imagine, you know, just fucking fisting.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So, as you know, this is</p>
      
        <p>probably true even now, uh,</p>
      
        <p>2007 now, that you could put almost</p>
      
        <p>anything online, except</p>
      
        <p>obviously anything to do with underage kids.</p>
      
        <p>And,</p>
      
        <p>but soon as you put it on VHS</p>
      
        <p>or DVD in United</p>
      
        <p>States, you are judged by local community</p>
      
        <p>standards. So, every city, state is different.</p>
      
        <p>So, you don't want it for something,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>edgy in PornHub, because police could,</p>
      
        <p>uh, invade, uh,</p>
      
        <p>arrest everybody, and they would stop buying</p>
      
        <p>a product. So, we have to be pretty,</p>
      
        <p>kind of, censor ourselves. And,</p>
      
        <p>uh, this is the law back in 2007.</p>
      
        <p>Fisting is</p>
      
        <p>legal, as long as</p>
      
        <p>you don't put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>So, this is,</p>
      
        <p>this is true story.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not making,</p>
      
        <p>you could put four fingers</p>
      
        <p>in somebody's mouth, anus, and vagina,</p>
      
        <p>but soon as you put a,</p>
      
        <p>we have a lawyer here, soon as, um,</p>
      
        <p>Not that kind of lawyer.</p>
      
        <p>Soon as you put a thumb, it's</p>
      
        <p>illegal, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, uh, well, first of all,</p>
      
        <p>I asked my boss a couple questions, like,</p>
      
        <p>so, lawmakers that sit</p>
      
        <p>down and make this rule, like, somebody,</p>
      
        <p>somebody have to come up with this rule, right? I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean? Somebody,</p>
      
        <p>somebody have to, and, you know, I'm so dumb,</p>
      
        <p>I think, like, English law, you know those</p>
      
        <p>English court, like, here he,</p>
      
        <p>here he, you know,</p>
      
        <p>they got the white, that white thick hair</p>
      
        <p>thing, a heart, how's</p>
      
        <p>the comment, you know, they're debating, like, I</p>
      
        <p>say, sir, we should have</p>
      
        <p>thumb and, uh,</p>
      
        <p>index finger, and then they debate, like,</p>
      
        <p>the great compromise</p>
      
        <p>of thumb of something something long,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know, so they keep the compromise,</p>
      
        <p>you can't, you can't, I don't know why, maybe</p>
      
        <p>it's in the Bible, you can't, you know, put a thumb</p>
      
        <p>in there.</p>
      
        <p>So when, so when</p>
      
        <p>my boss told me about the thumb, I said,</p>
      
        <p>well, Chris,</p>
      
        <p>what happens if a person's missing</p>
      
        <p>a thumb?</p>
      
        <p>Law specifically</p>
      
        <p>say, if you put a thumb</p>
      
        <p>in there, you get in trouble, and obviously,</p>
      
        <p>somebody missing a thumb</p>
      
        <p>can't put a thumb in there, because</p>
      
        <p>they're missing a thumb, this person could put</p>
      
        <p>all the way in somebody's mouth, anus, and vagina,</p>
      
        <p>it's legal.</p>
      
        <p>In porn business, this is known as rule of thumb.</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>see?</p>
      
        <p>You learn something, right? So,</p>
      
        <p>and,</p>
      
        <p>that's my job,</p>
      
        <p>and, and one time,</p>
      
        <p>you know, um, sometimes</p>
      
        <p>you see something very ambiguous,</p>
      
        <p>like, I don't know where, if,</p>
      
        <p>if we're breaking the law, so,</p>
      
        <p>um, one time Rocco was</p>
      
        <p>fucking this girl in an ass, he put too much lube,</p>
      
        <p>so one time he went in, all the way</p>
      
        <p>in, when he pulled out,</p>
      
        <p>all this liquid flew out of her asshole.</p>
      
        <p>And, it's very fussy,</p>
      
        <p>have you ever seen this, like, old</p>
      
        <p>UFO pictures, or like, uh,</p>
      
        <p>um, um,</p>
      
        <p>or, you know, like, what's that</p>
      
        <p>monster in America, um,</p>
      
        <p>Sasquatch.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, Sasquatch, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know how Sasquatch is kinda fuzzy?</p>
      
        <p>So, um, or when JFK got shot,</p>
      
        <p>and everything's kinda fuzzy, right? So,</p>
      
        <p>I'm looking at the liquid,</p>
      
        <p>it's very ambiguous, like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I'm looking from here,</p>
      
        <p>it looks clear, but from this angle,</p>
      
        <p>it looks orange-ish.</p>
      
        <p>It's like a very orange-greenish color,</p>
      
        <p>so, I don't know if that's shit, because you can't</p>
      
        <p>have shit, except in New York and Portland,</p>
