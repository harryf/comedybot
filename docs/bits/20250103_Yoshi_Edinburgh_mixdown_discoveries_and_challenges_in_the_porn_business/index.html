        <p>Ladies, I don't know if you're married,</p>
      
        <p>but if you're not married, it's because it's not,</p>
      
        <p>oh, don't shake your hand.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not shaking.</p>
      
        <p>If marriage is important to the guy, he would've done it.</p>
      
        <p>So push that guy to, you know, take crackhead,</p>
      
        <p>put some pressure on the guy, right?</p>
      
        <p>10%, 1% of crackhead, because it'll make you happy.</p>
      
        <p>Now, you know, there's other times, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what to do because</p>
      
        <p>like, a guy walked in and said,</p>
      
        <p>hey sir, do you have a movie called</p>
      
        <p>Cr√®me de la Face number seven?</p>
      
        <p>Excellent choice.</p>
      
        <p>So, I gave him the tape, and all of a sudden,</p>
      
        <p>his eye got red, and he started crying.</p>
      
        <p>I thought it was a medical emergency.</p>
      
        <p>I thought he was sick.</p>
      
        <p>He said, is everything okay?</p>
      
        <p>He goes, oh my God, that's my fiancee on the cover.</p>
      
        <p>So it's her face with eight penises hovering her head.</p>
      
        <p>She looks like Medusa, and-</p>
      
        <p>He's getting married to her in a week, and she's like,</p>
      
        <p>you're gonna do it?</p>
      
        <p>And his friend finally told him about it.</p>
      
        <p>So he's crying, so I have two questions.</p>
      
        <p>Are you crying because she did porn,</p>
      
        <p>or are you crying because she doesn't do</p>
      
        <p>the same thing for you?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what's the problem, right?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know, I'm not a doctor, so I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>So he's crying, and his nose is running,</p>
      
        <p>so the whole thing combined together,</p>
      
        <p>it just dropped on the box, you know,</p>
      
        <p>just like in the movie.</p>
      
        <p>So, now, the next story, this story I'm gonna tell you,</p>
      
        <p>this is actually the first story that I wrote.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I do comic, so this is the storytelling,</p>
      
        <p>I don't really do this, I usually just tell jokes.</p>
      
        <p>This is like July of COVID year.</p>
      
        <p>So I was stuck in Northern Arizona,</p>
      
        <p>and I'm walking 10 miles a day,</p>
      
        <p>calling my friends, I'm taking online courses,</p>
      
        <p>but eventually I'm running out of things to do,</p>
      
        <p>so one night I wrote a story,</p>
      
        <p>and my friend edited the story,</p>
      
        <p>and I'm playing Instagram.</p>
      
        <p>It's not a funny story, at all, actually.</p>
      
        <p>It's not funny.</p>
      
        <p>And I thought it was kind of dumb story, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Then, it really shocked me because</p>
      
        <p>next 48 hours it's been just a crazy positive response.</p>
      
        <p>People really love this story.</p>
      
        <p>So this story is, December of 1999,</p>
      
        <p>I'm working midnight to nine am, shift,</p>
      
        <p>it's terrible weather, it's just snow everywhere,</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, oh my god, there's never gonna be no customer.</p>
      
        <p>So I start at night, 1 a.m., a guy walks in.</p>
      
        <p>Really good looking guy, like you,</p>
      
        <p>he's just got Ferragamo shoes, Ralph Lauren,</p>
      
        <p>just expensive clothes.</p>
      
        <p>Not a typical porn star customer,</p>
      
        <p>but you know, good looking guy.</p>
      
        <p>So you walk in, and I say hello,</p>
      
        <p>he doesn't say anything, he's like, okay.</p>
      
        <p>Then 10 minutes later, he come back and say,</p>
      
        <p>sir, could you help me find a movie?</p>
      
        <p>I said, of course, that's my job.</p>
      
        <p>I said, do you know the porn star's name?</p>
      
        <p>Production company, is it Finnish,</p>
      
        <p>is it Japanese, European, American company?</p>
      
        <p>Every question is no, no, no, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>So I said, sir, you know, we have like 10,000 tapes.</p>
      
        <p>Even if we have it, I don't know how I'm gonna help you</p>
      
        <p>find this movie, and he kinda looked down and said,</p>
      
        <p>well, I really need you to help me find my daughter.</p>
      
        <p>And I thought, you know, so I'll be honest,</p>
      
        <p>I was kinda laughing inside, thinking, oh,</p>
      
        <p>I bet she did porn, and the dad needs evidence, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So confront her.</p>
      
        <p>I wish that was a,</p>
