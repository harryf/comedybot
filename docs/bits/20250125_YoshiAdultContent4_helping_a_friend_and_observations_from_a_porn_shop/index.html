        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>Well...</p>
      
        <p>One time, a guy walked in.</p>
      
        <p>He said, um, I need help with something.</p>
      
        <p>Like, what do you need?</p>
      
        <p>He was kind of a little embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>You could imagine, like, we all have...</p>
      
        <p>When you're young, you're learning about sex, and you don't have anybody to talk to.</p>
      
        <p>You know...</p>
      
        <p>Back then, you don't really have online, so you gotta ask people.</p>
      
        <p>So, I understand people get embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>But...</p>
      
        <p>He was saying, like, do you have, like, a special spray for ladies?</p>
      
        <p>Like, what purpose?</p>
      
        <p>He didn't really want to say, but eventually he explained...</p>
      
        <p>His girlfriend...</p>
      
        <p>Uh, fiancee...</p>
      
        <p>She have a very distinct smell down here.</p>
      
        <p>It kind of bugs him.</p>
      
        <p>So I said, like, well, how bad does it smell?</p>
      
        <p>He said...</p>
      
        <p>Well, imagine you use...</p>
      
        <p>Baby's diaper.</p>
      
        <p>Sit in hot sun for, like, two weeks.</p>
      
        <p>That smell better than what his girlfriend's pussy smells like.</p>
      
        <p>Basically, her pussy smells like garbage.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>It just smells bad.</p>
      
        <p>So, after talking to him, here's the problem.</p>
      
        <p>He doesn't like the smell, but he can't say it to her because it's gonna hurt her feelings.</p>
      
        <p>Right? That makes sense, right?</p>
      
        <p>So he's suffering in silence.</p>
      
        <p>So he's praying.</p>
      
        <p>He's crying every time he goes down there.</p>
      
        <p>But she thinks her pussy is so delicious...</p>
      
        <p>He's crying deliciousness.</p>
      
        <p>He's crying deliciousness. Right?</p>
      
        <p>He's not crying because it's delicious.</p>
      
        <p>He's crying because he's in pain.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>Men and women miscommunicate all the time.</p>
      
        <p>But, you know, tears of joy...</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no, no. Tears of suffering.</p>
      
        <p>So I said,</p>
      
        <p>Sir, let me get this straight.</p>
      
        <p>You want to make sure she knows it smells bad down there.</p>
      
        <p>Without hurting her feelings.</p>
      
        <p>Yes. Trust Uncle Yoshi.</p>
      
        <p>If you're in this position, guys,</p>
      
        <p>this is what you do.</p>
      
        <p>You get two fingers and put it in her vagina for like seven minutes.</p>
      
        <p>Five to ten minutes, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like this for ten minutes.</p>
      
        <p>Like ten minutes, right?</p>
      
        <p>And once you get it and pulled it out, you have a thick liquid going across your finger, right?</p>
      
        <p>You have a thick liquid going across your finger, right?</p>
      
        <p>Then,</p>
      
        <p>you put it in her mouth.</p>
      
        <p>Then...</p>
      
        <p>Then she knows!</p>
      
        <p>It doesn't taste like home cooking.</p>
      
        <p>Right? You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>It tastes</p>
      
        <p>really salty.</p>
      
        <p>And she...</p>
      
        <p>I mean...</p>
      
        <p>You know it's bad pussing when she starts crying too.</p>
      
        <p>And the lady...</p>
      
        <p>She's not crying because tears of joy.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>Because sex is very complicated.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>It's not an easy thing to talk about.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know,</p>
      
        <p>You know when you go to Apple Store,</p>
      
        <p>there's a Junius bar?</p>
      
        <p>When you go to a porn shop, you have a pervert bar.</p>
      
        <p>I'm the expert in-house pervert.</p>
      
        <p>That's my job, right?</p>
      
        <p>Can I tell you something?</p>
      
        <p>I said about Apple Store in Ukraine,</p>
      
        <p>recently in Kyiv,</p>
      
        <p>You know what they say?</p>
      
        <p>We don't have Apple Store, right?</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know that. They were getting mad at me for not having Apple Store, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, like,</p>
      
        <p>They ask me all kinds of questions, you know,</p>
      
        <p>when I want to help them with their problems.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>This guy walked in, right?</p>
      
        <p>He looked very young.</p>
      
        <p>In fact, he looked like 16 almost.</p>
      
        <p>Like, sir, you can't come in here.</p>
      
        <p>So he showed me ID.</p>
      
        <p>He just turned 18 that day.</p>
      
        <p>So I said, happy birthday, right?</p>
      
        <p>Coming in of age!</p>
      
        <p>So he turned 18.</p>
      
        <p>So he went to the section, he's looking for movies.</p>
      
        <p>And they mentioned, hey, could you help me?</p>
      
        <p>And he said, I'm trying to find really good gay movies, right?</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>I don't watch gay porn, but I can't say, ooh, that's sick.</p>
      
        <p>I can't say that, right?</p>
      
        <p>You don't want to make anybody feel bad.</p>
      
        <p>So what I do is,</p>
      
        <p>I read movie reviews.</p>
      
        <p>So when people ask me movies I don't watch,</p>
      
        <p>I'm ready to, like,</p>
      
        <p>I say, well, sir, the best companies are</p>
      
        <p>Mustang, Vulcan, Bellamy, and stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>In fact, here is Jeff Stryker.</p>
      
        <p>He just won AVN Gay Awards.</p>
      
        <p>And this movie got five dicks out of five dick.</p>
      
        <p>And, uh,</p>
      
        <p>I highly recommend,</p>
      
        <p>uh,</p>
      
        <p>look, and I show the box, and I show his asshole,</p>
      
        <p>like, look at how delicious this asshole looks like, right?</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>men and women,</p>
      
        <p>I don't like hairy buttholes, but that's just me.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, um, so,</p>
      
        <p>I gave, I gave him this gay, uh, porn.</p>
      
        <p>He rented, he came back,</p>
      
        <p>and, uh, you know what it is?</p>
      
        <p>I think he was a little confused.</p>
      
        <p>He, he,</p>
      
        <p>I remember he gave me answers, like, uh,</p>
      
        <p>from Billingham, which is, like, way</p>
      
        <p>two hours to Washington State, uh, two hours north of Seattle.</p>
      
        <p>It's like middle of Booney.</p>
      
        <p>It's like a little farm town.</p>
      
        <p>And you know, if you live in, like, small town, they don't have gay bars, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, he really didn't have experience talking to other gay people, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, I think maybe</p>
      
        <p>he didn't know.</p>
      
        <p>So, next day, because he fell back</p>
      
        <p>renting gay porn, he got four</p>
      
        <p>heterosexual</p>
      
        <p>movies, right?</p>
      
        <p>Do any of you eat sushi?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
      
        <p>You know that ginger thing on the side?</p>
      
        <p>So, when you eat sushi,</p>
      
        <p>you want to get the full flavor.</p>
      
        <p>You eat the ginger, it kind of wipes the taste.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think what he was trying to do is</p>
      
        <p>he watched gay porn,</p>
      
        <p>used heterosexual</p>
      
        <p>tape to wipe that gay shit</p>
      
        <p>from their tongue, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, I say, you know what, sir?</p>
      
        <p>If you want to rent heterosexual tape, that's fine.</p>
      
        <p>Because I make commission out of these things, right?</p>
      
        <p>But if you're</p>
      
        <p>gay,</p>
      
        <p>but if you're gay, you should feel</p>
      
        <p>bad. It's okay.</p>
      
        <p>There's millions of people gay.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you shouldn't feel bad</p>
      
        <p>about that.</p>
      
        <p>You know what he told me? This is</p>
      
        <p>why kids are more thoughtful, I think,</p>
      
        <p>in the late 90s than now.</p>
      
        <p>You know what was</p>
      
        <p>his biggest concern?</p>
      
        <p>He didn't want his parents to think</p>
      
        <p>he became gay because</p>
      
        <p>it was bad parenting.</p>
      
        <p>He didn't want to hurt his parents' feelings, right?</p>
      
        <p>You think kids these days</p>
      
        <p>sound like that? Fuck no.</p>
      
        <p>You know why?</p>
      
        <p>Because one time I went to my friend</p>
      
        <p>Ruben's house,</p>
      
        <p>I walked in, and I haven't seen</p>
      
        <p>his son Sebastian, like 14. Last time I saw him,</p>
      
        <p>he was like 3 or 4 years old.</p>
      
        <p>So, I give or take, he's 17, 18,</p>
      
        <p>as soon as I walk in the house, Sebastian goes</p>
      
        <p>and says, fuck you mom, fuck you dad,</p>
      
        <p>and fuck you grandma. He's talking like that.</p>
      
        <p>You know?</p>
      
        <p>So, I say, Sebastian, your family's not</p>
      
        <p>Why are you talking to your family like that?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why that's funny,</p>
      
        <p>but okay.</p>
      
        <p>I said, Sebastian,</p>
      
        <p>they're nice people. I know your</p>
      
        <p>dad since 1982,</p>
      
        <p>he's a great guy.</p>
      
        <p>Why are you talking to your family like that?</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, you don't understand.</p>
      
        <p>My family hate me because</p>
      
        <p>I'm gay. Oh no.</p>
      
        <p>They don't hate you because you're gay.</p>
      
        <p>They hate you because you're a fucking asshole.</p>
      
        <p>That's a big difference right there.</p>
      
        <p>I understand being a young</p>
      
        <p>homosexual, you're into assholes,</p>
      
        <p>but you don't have to be one.</p>
      
        <p>People misreading the situation.</p>
      
        <p>Just like,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what it is to be transgender.</p>
      
        <p>It must be difficult.</p>
      
        <p>You're born, you identify</p>
      
        <p>different gender.</p>
      
        <p>I can't even imagine.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't choose to have this face.</p>
      
        <p>I can't even imagine.</p>
      
        <p>You see K-pop,</p>
      
        <p>you don't want that face.</p>
      
        <p>So I understand.</p>
      
        <p>So if you're born, and you identify</p>
      
        <p>with different sex, I can't even imagine.</p>
      
        <p>That's probably even more difficult</p>
      
        <p>than being a gay person.</p>
      
        <p>But have you noticed sometimes</p>
      
        <p>these transgender activists,</p>
      
        <p>they're screaming and yelling,</p>
      
        <p>they're getting angry, because they're hurt.</p>
      
        <p>They're in pain,</p>
      
        <p>because nobody showed them love and respect.</p>
      
        <p>They're screaming and yelling, saying,</p>
      
        <p>you hate people, you hate me because transgender.</p>
      
        <p>I say, oh no.</p>
      
        <p>They don't hate you because you're transgender.</p>
      
        <p>They hate you because you're fucking ugly.</p>
      
        <p>Okay?</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>You know how you could tell a transgender person</p>
      
        <p>is ugly? If they have to say,</p>
      
        <p>sir, excuse me sir, I'm a woman.</p>
      
        <p>Bitch, you're ugly.</p>
      
        <p>If you have to tell people you're a woman,</p>
