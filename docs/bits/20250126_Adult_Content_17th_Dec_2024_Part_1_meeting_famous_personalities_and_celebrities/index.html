        <p>And here comes the fucking hotel.</p>
      
        <p>And notice, I've been working for, look, the execs are, for many years now, nine to</p>
      
        <p>three years, and I've announced that my phone number is not still running.</p>
      
        <p>This old man is committing a crime.</p>
      
        <p>This is my next</p>
      
        <p>down the road.</p>
      
        <p>He was.</p>
      
        <p>He said, I want 200.</p>
      
        <p>Fuck you, I'll give you 10.</p>
      
        <p>All right, same thing.</p>
      
        <p>Can I say something?</p>
      
        <p>Crack dealers are no tender Kissinger.</p>
      
        <p>They're not very, they don't know how to negotiate.</p>
      
        <p>So these are the kind of shit I had to deal with.</p>
      
        <p>So after five years of working there,</p>
      
        <p>I just learned so much about human nature</p>
      
        <p>and dealing with the customer.</p>
      
        <p>I decided to move, I wasn't getting along with my,</p>
      
        <p>like I was telling her, I haven't spoken to my mom</p>
      
        <p>in over 20 years, I said, I just wasn't getting along.</p>
      
        <p>Remember, I have to walk with my pants down.</p>
      
        <p>So 2003, I moved from Seattle, Washington to Los Angeles.</p>
      
        <p>I ended up working for a company called Evil Angel,</p>
      
        <p>one of the biggest gonzo company.</p>
      
        <p>And for those of you, traditionally what they used to make</p>
      
        <p>is feature film.</p>
      
        <p>Feature film means there's actually script, dialogue.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why they did it is because</p>
      
        <p>trying to protect them.</p>
      
        <p>And so from government, because anything with</p>
      
        <p>little bit of intellectual creativity,</p>
      
        <p>you're protecting them for the first amendment.</p>
      
        <p>You know, that's why they make movie called Schindler's Fest.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you get the idea.</p>
      
        <p>Well, by late 80s, there was a case against</p>
      
        <p>all the pornographers in LA, where LAPD went after</p>
      
        <p>a pornographer in late 80s in LA, and the pornographers,</p>
      
        <p>actually won.</p>
      
        <p>So what happened was all the perverts from like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, in California and in New York, they moved to LA,</p>
      
        <p>hence creating in San Fernando, Porn Valley,</p>
      
        <p>because now there's a lot of warehouses,</p>
      
        <p>a lot of space north of Hollywood,</p>
      
        <p>and they're protected under the law.</p>
      
        <p>Customers .</p>
      
        <p>You look like one of the porn guy I remember.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not kidding.</p>
      
        <p>There's a guy named Scott Lyon,</p>
      
        <p>he did a lot of porn by the way.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if that's a customer.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, you know what that reminds me of?</p>
      
        <p>I did a show with my friend Jason,</p>
      
        <p>around Oslo, Norway, I think two,</p>
      
        <p>we did a show maybe seven to 10 days</p>
      
        <p>after the big terrorist attack.</p>
      
        <p>Remember about 10th of November in Oslo.</p>
      
        <p>Long life, yes.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, so we were doing a show, and,</p>
      
        <p>and you know who was in the audience?</p>
      
        <p>Jasmine St. Clair, does anybody recognize that name?</p>
      
        <p>She did like 500 gangbang, like 20 years ago.</p>
      
        <p>I recognize, well, I recognize her right away.</p>
      
        <p>Not because I saw her face, I saw her ankle.</p>
      
        <p>Because I remember body parts better.</p>
      
        <p>So I saw her, right?</p>
      
        <p>So it's just really weird,</p>
      
        <p>because you know, my mind works a little,</p>
      
        <p>my mind works really weird because on one hand,</p>
      
        <p>I'm, I'm, I'm reconciled to the fact that 10 days ago,</p>
      
        <p>all these people got fucking killed and bombed,</p>
      
        <p>and all their body parts are all over the Oslo.</p>
      
        <p>And I see Jasmine St. Clair where her body's all over the place</p>
      
        <p>because she's fucking 500 men, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I have, I, oh.</p>
      
        <p>Are you okay?</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, okay, good.</p>
      
        <p>You should have done it on the book.</p>
      
        <p>I think this is really shit.</p>
      
        <p>I'm pretty good.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, no, no, I just wanted to,</p>
      
        <p>hey, did I make you sick?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, okay, I'm good.</p>
      
        <p>I'm sorry, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>I haven't even got the gross part yet.</p>
      
        <p>This is how,</p>
      
        <p>this is how psychotic I am, right?</p>
      
        <p>This is how crazy I am.</p>
      
        <p>Because in college, I studied accounting and economics,</p>
      
        <p>and I remember going to one of the gang bang,</p>
      
        <p>it was making me so angry.</p>
      
        <p>You know why?</p>
      
        <p>Because I was one of those crazy person in a corner</p>
      
        <p>counting exactly how many guys she was fucking.</p>
      
        <p>And the number is, they're lying.</p>
      
        <p>Those numbers are real.</p>
      
        <p>And sometimes they're used to saying that three times.</p>
      
        <p>That's not 500 guys.</p>
      
        <p>It was like 261.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>That's me sleep, so like,</p>
      
        <p>that's the kind of shit makes me mad, like lying about.</p>
      
        <p>I was literally counting.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, you were reallyå˜‰?</p>
      
        <p>Just watching.</p>
      
        <p>I was.</p>
      
        <p>You guys are still okay or should I,</p>
      
        <p>I stayed yeah, okay.</p>
      
        <p>So I, so I end up working for</p>
      
        <p>a guy named John Spielano aka Buttman.</p>
      
        <p>Can I leave you something?</p>
      
        <p>I'm a lot older than you guys.</p>
      
        <p>Curious advice but.</p>
      
        <p>If you end up working for a guy named Buttman.</p>
      
        <p>Iee.</p>
      
        <p>made some bad decisions in your life, right?</p>
      
        <p>And he owns a company called Evil Angel.</p>
      
        <p>The reason it's called Evil Angel is because</p>
      
        <p>John used to be a male</p>
      
        <p>Chippendale dancer. There was another guy</p>
      
        <p>named John, and</p>
      
        <p>his routine was dressed</p>
      
        <p>like a vampire. That's why they call him Evil John.</p>
      
        <p>And at the time,</p>
      
        <p>he was dating a girl named Angel.</p>
      
        <p>So hence, the company Evil Angel.</p>
      
        <p>So anytime</p>
      
        <p>anybody asks my mom or somebody's family members,</p>
      
        <p>what did your son do?</p>
      
        <p>Because I work for a company</p>
      
        <p>called Evil Angel</p>
      
        <p>EA.</p>
      
        <p>My family tells them that I work for a company</p>
      
        <p>called EA. Of course,</p>
      
        <p>everyone who plays video games</p>
      
        <p>knows our name.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not ashamed of working</p>
      
        <p>in porno, but</p>
      
        <p>they really are embarrassed by it.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know,</p>
      
        <p>five, six</p>
      
        <p>years retail, nine years.</p>
      
        <p>Evil Angel</p>
      
        <p>is one of the</p>
      
        <p>biggest porn companies.</p>
      
        <p>And to give you an idea,</p>
      
        <p>one of our premier</p>
      
        <p>directors was Robert Cifredi,</p>
      
        <p>and I'm sure some of you recognize him.</p>
      
        <p>He's one of the biggest porn stars in Europe.</p>
      
        <p>Nacho Vidal and people like that.</p>
      
        <p>So what did I do? I did PR for Evil Angel</p>
      
        <p>Public Relations.</p>
      
        <p>I'll give a little more detail later on.</p>
      
        <p>But my job was mostly</p>
      
        <p>I was a DVD producer.</p>
      
        <p>And basically, my job is</p>
      
        <p>watch porno, design the DVD,</p>
      
        <p>make it easy</p>
      
        <p>for people to masturbate.</p>
      
        <p>So I put</p>
      
        <p>chapter points.</p>
      
        <p>Not based on the story points</p>
      
        <p>like Hollywood.</p>
      
        <p>I put it, I put points where</p>
      
        <p>this is a...</p>
      
        <p>This is your job.</p>
      
        <p>I love your job.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm talking about, sir.</p>
      
        <p>The point I pick is like,</p>
      
        <p>OK, this is the point you should</p>
      
        <p>start masturbating because</p>
      
        <p>by the time it starts,</p>
      
        <p>yeah, you're ready to go.</p>
      
        <p>So that's my job.</p>
      
        <p>So like, I had to put the pervert</p>
      
        <p>cat and just sit there, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, so this, you know,</p>
      
        <p>that was my job.</p>
      
        <p>And believe me, sometimes.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, I had to make sure.</p>
      
        <p>I know this is funny.</p>
      
        <p>University was full list.</p>
      
        <p>I know this is kind of funny thing to say,</p>
      
        <p>but I have to make sure all the names</p>
      
        <p>are spelled correctly.</p>
      
        <p>I had to make a cast list, like scene one.</p>
      
        <p>I had to make sure everybody in the right scene,</p>
      
        <p>democracy behind the scene, bonus scene,</p>
      
        <p>H2L.</p>
      
        <p>I even have to put music for that movie.</p>
      
        <p>And I got to put trailers and all kinds of stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>And believe me, I, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I'm clicking to 61, you know, gang bang.</p>
      
        <p>You know, I'm taking this job really seriously.</p>
      
        <p>So one time there was a scene where two girl,</p>
      
        <p>two guy and a girl, they were having sex and</p>
      
        <p>it was like, oh, I'm going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, oh, I'm going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>It's an anal scene.</p>
      
        <p>And he put too much lube.</p>
      
        <p>So he was going in for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>And one time he, when he pulled his dick out,</p>
      
        <p>all this liquid just flew out.</p>
      
        <p>And the color is very ambiguous.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>The reason why it's concerned, because if people think it's shit,</p>
      
        <p>the police could invade the local porn shop and arrest</p>
      
        <p>them and lock the shop up.</p>
      
        <p>So they're very, very serious because you know,</p>
      
        <p>you can put almost anything online except, you know,</p>
      
        <p>like obviously underage.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, I'm not talking about underage stuff or anything</p>
      
        <p>to do with animals.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, when I say animal, I'm not talking about Puerto Ricans.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So if the authority thinks that shit,</p>
      
        <p>if the authority thinks shit, we could get in trouble.</p>
      
        <p>So I have to sit down and, you know, use my equipment.</p>
      
        <p>And I got like going backward.</p>
      
        <p>So I have to go.</p>
      
        <p>In, in, back in the ass, out of the ass.</p>
      
        <p>Into the ass, out of the ass.</p>
      
        <p>And I just can't make a decision.</p>
      
        <p>So what do I do?</p>
      
        <p>I blame my colleague.</p>
      
        <p>If as though this is like Supreme Court decision, right?</p>
      
        <p>So like, so there's like eight of us.</p>
      
        <p>We all have to sit down.</p>
      
        <p>You know, four people say shit, four people say nay.</p>
      
        <p>Well, this is a dead knock, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I have to bring the nine person, the general manager,</p>
      
        <p>like, like Supreme Court keeps justice, right?</p>
      
        <p>So he have to look at it and like, that's fine.</p>
      
        <p>Just leave it in there.</p>
      
        <p>So, so, you know, because if I don't ask and release it</p>
      
        <p>and we get in trouble, we have to bring everything back.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to cost the company a lot of money.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, this is like some fucking serious matters,</p>
      
        <p>you know.</p>
      
        <p>Another time my boss say,</p>
      
        <p>this is during 2007 and 8, and that was a very critical time</p>
      
        <p>because, because, you know, several things.</p>
      
        <p>It was during the financial crisis too.</p>
      
        <p>iPhone was invented.</p>
      
        <p>Pornhub was created.</p>
      
        <p>So all of a sudden, not only did people are watching convenience</p>
      
        <p>at home on the cell phone, but they were able</p>
      
        <p>to watch a bunch of free stuff.</p>
      
        <p>And it's a big concern for porn business.</p>
      
        <p>It got really, really bad from 2007 and 8 on.</p>
      
        <p>So my boss at the time said, well, we obviously need to make new movies</p>
      
        <p>to bring the new customer back, right?</p>
      
        <p>Bring new customer.</p>
      
        <p>You know, my boss's idea was we should start making fisting movies.</p>
      
        <p>Now, you can put anything online, but as soon as you put in physical things</p>
      
        <p>like DVD and VHS, once again, it's covered by local jurisdiction, right?</p>
      
        <p>So this is the law in 2007.</p>
      
        <p>Fisting is legal as long as you don't put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>That's the law.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why.</p>
      
        <p>But you know what that tells me?</p>
      
        <p>There was a group of lawmakers sitting in the office.</p>
      
        <p>I have a discussion, like, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, is this Hammurabi's code from a Sumerian, or is this a biblical version?</p>
      
        <p>Or, you know, is it from old?</p>
      
        <p>I have no idea, but there's a bunch of guys sit down and say, this is the law.</p>
      
        <p>You can't put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>So when my boss told me about that, I asked him, like, well, Chris, what happens if a</p>
      
        <p>person's missing a thumb?</p>
      
        <p>Laws specifically said as long as you don't put a thumb in there, it's legal.</p>
      
        <p>And obviously, someone missing a thumb couldn't possibly put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>In this particular situation, it's okay.</p>
      
        <p>In porn business, this is known as rule of thumb.</p>
      
        <p>And so, you know, you're learning stuff.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, I could go, but I'll do a couple other facets of what I had to deal with, like,</p>
      
        <p>the last 10 years or so.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, that was kind of my job.</p>
      
        <p>And when my favorite comedian friend used to start getting Jay Leno, tonight's with</p>
      
        <p>Jay Leno.</p>
      
        <p>I used to go with him.</p>
      
        <p>And then when one of the producers found out I'd written Porn Shop and I did stand-up,</p>
      
        <p>they said, like, hey, you know, anytime if we need any sort of porn reference, we'll</p>
      
        <p>contact you.</p>
      
        <p>Well, you know what happened after that, for the next almost nine years, anytime any porn</p>
      
        <p>star, I mean, not porn, anytime you're talking to any Hollywood star and they mention they</p>
      
        <p>like porn, I'll bring him a box of porn.</p>
      
        <p>For example, Seth Rollins loves porn.</p>
      
        <p>I used to bring him a box of porn for him.</p>
      
        <p>And his girlfriend who became his wife, they were big fans.</p>
      
        <p>So they brought it in.</p>
      
        <p>Another time, I brought porn for Jonah Hill.</p>
      
        <p>But, you know, the second time we were about it, he said, no, no, no, my girlfriend's here.</p>
      
        <p>Just take it away.</p>
      
        <p>You know, so like, I had to deal with that kind of shit, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So I meet a lot of interesting people in Hollywood.</p>
      
        <p>And you know what was interesting about this?</p>
      
        <p>When you make work out of fantasy, there's no longer going to be fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>Because a lot of my friends say, it must be fun working porn plus seeing naked stuff all the time.</p>
      
        <p>I'm telling you, anytime, I'm sure like if I like amateur, like a bartender, that might be fun.</p>
      
        <p>But as soon as you make a job out of it, I'm sure it's fun sometimes.</p>
      
        <p>But I'm sure sometimes it's like fucking shit, right?</p>
      
        <p>People are like scumbags and they don't tip well.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you don't have to say it.</p>
      
        <p>But when you make work out of fantasy, it's no longer fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>This is a big, interesting.</p>
      
        <p>A lesson because every time I went to try show, guys who are actors wish they're athletes or singers.</p>
      
        <p>So it's never enough even if you reach the peak of fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>And this is the thing.</p>
