        <p>Since you don't know me, I want to tell you a couple quick stories</p>
      
        <p>to kick up my personality.</p>
      
        <p>Six years ago, my roommate Rick, Irish-American guy,</p>
      
        <p>it's been his lifetime dream to go to Japan.</p>
      
        <p>So he went.</p>
      
        <p>And the only thing I have to do is take care of our apartment,</p>
      
        <p>and nothing happened to his cat Juanito.</p>
      
        <p>Well, actually, he thought it was a girl,</p>
      
        <p>so we called it Juanita for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>But as soon as we found out it was a boy, we changed it to Juanito.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So he left.</p>
      
        <p>A couple days later, as I'm walking out of the apartment,</p>
      
        <p>huge explosion in Los Angeles.</p>
      
        <p>It's a couple days away from Fourth of July.</p>
      
        <p>So a goddamn cat ran out of the apartment.</p>
      
        <p>I lost the cat.</p>
      
        <p>So here's my dilemma.</p>
      
        <p>What do I do?</p>
      
        <p>Do I contact Rick and ruin his vacation?</p>
      
        <p>Or take a chance, hopefully I could find a cat within the next 14 days?</p>
      
        <p>I really couldn't make a decision.</p>
      
        <p>So this is what my Rick's mom said.</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son's cat,</p>
      
        <p>and you don't give him the opportunity to look for the cat,</p>
      
        <p>he's going to resent you, so I think you should tell him.</p>
      
        <p>And I thought, you know what?</p>
      
        <p>She's right.</p>
      
        <p>So I emailed him.</p>
      
        <p>Because the time difference between the US and Japan,</p>
      
        <p>he finally called me 14 hours later.</p>
      
        <p>Have you ever had a conversation with someone who's been crying for a long time?</p>
      
        <p>I could just hear him about his story, like, oh my God.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat,</p>
      
        <p>but I've got to say something here.</p>
      
        <p>I thought, oh my God.</p>
      
        <p>He's going to ask him to move out.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat?</p>
      
        <p>Eat cat?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not Chinese.</p>
      
        <p>I'm from Japan.</p>
      
        <p>We don't eat our Lord and Savior Hello Kitty.</p>
      
        <p>So that's not our Japanese Jesus.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, you know, we do that prayer.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, so a couple days, she said, please, whatever you do,</p>
      
        <p>can you look for my cat?</p>
      
        <p>So you know, like midnight, 3 AM, 6 AM, 9, noon, you get that idea.</p>
      
        <p>Every three hours, I'm walking around the neighborhood like a crazy person,</p>
      
        <p>shaking cats food and saying, Juanito, for like the next couple weeks.</p>
      
        <p>And this fucking cat is gone.</p>
      
        <p>And so I got desperate.</p>
      
        <p>I went to my friend's podcast.</p>
      
        <p>It's really popular in Los Angeles.</p>
      
        <p>So I went on the podcast.</p>
      
        <p>If you want to volunteer, help me look for the cat.</p>
      
        <p>I live in Hollywood in Edgemont.</p>
      
        <p>Please contact me.</p>
      
        <p>And better yet, if you find the cat,</p>
      
        <p>please contact me.</p>
      
        <p>This is why I made a mistake.</p>
      
        <p>This is America.</p>
      
        <p>I give my personal cell phone number and podcast.</p>
      
        <p>So I think about 50,000 people downloaded the episode.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, about 50,000 people had access to my cell phone number.</p>
      
        <p>Within an hour of the podcast release, somebody texts me a message saying,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, I think I found your cat.</p>
      
        <p>I clicked the picture.</p>
      
        <p>It's a picture of a huge cock.</p>
      
        <p>Harry told me, oh, that's the chapped eye.</p>
      
        <p>That's the name of the, is that how you say it in English?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, the chapped eye.</p>
      
        <p>Because in Asian people have small eyes, look at that.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, anyway, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I never heard that one before.</p>
      
        <p>So like, you know, I'm desperate.</p>
      
        <p>And here's a weird thing.</p>
      
        <p>When my friend drove his motorcycle from LAX,</p>
      
        <p>the fucking cat reappeared.</p>
      
        <p>The whole goddamn time the cat was looking at me,</p>
      
        <p>it doesn't reappear.</p>
