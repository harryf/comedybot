    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>Fantastic.</p>
      
        <p>Because all day long they deal with drama.</p>
      
        <p>In the evening it's just peace and quiet.</p>
      
        <p>You just have a quarterly review now and again.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you've got to look at your KPIs, guys.</p>
      
        <p>Your key penis indicators.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, we're here.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know where we're going with this.</p>
      
        <p>It's penis jokes.</p>
      
        <p>We should be doing jokes about trans.</p>
      
        <p>I don't have any trans jokes tonight.</p>
      
        <p>How many of you guys are Swiss here, by the way?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, we do have some Swiss people.</p>
      
        <p>Very nice.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, you're in the minority, of course.</p>
      
        <p>It's nice to be reminded you're a minority.</p>
      
        <p>I'm actually, as Teddy said, I'm actually half English, half German.</p>
      
        <p>Which is funny, because normally when I tell people that,</p>
      
        <p>I have this joke, I go like,</p>
      
        <p>that means I want to take over the world.</p>
      
        <p>But I'm too polite to do it.</p>
      
        <p>For one time, actually, I was travelling in India and I did that joke.</p>
      
        <p>And they were like, yes, Germans.</p>
      
        <p>Very polite people.</p>
      
        <p>Excellent history knowledge.</p>
      
        <p>Do you have any Germans here?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, that's a great .</p>
      
        <p>I like the way she did the bag.</p>
      
        <p>She grabbed it off and take it down.</p>
      
        <p>Are you Frenchman as well?</p>
      
        <p>Where are you from?</p>
      
        <p>Let me see.</p>
      
        <p>Can I ask?</p>
      
        <p>Yes, you've got a Frenchman there.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if you know the German.</p>
      
        <p>Croatia.</p>
      
        <p>You're from Croatia?</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, this is an interesting cluster of a nation that goes.</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>I've got a German friend.</p>
      
        <p>No, no , no, no.</p>
      
        <p>Consort, where is face.</p>
      
        <p>No, bring it on back, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>All right, this is an interesting structure.</p>
      
        <p>All right, last question.</p>
