        <p>So what happened was, his daughter got killed</p>
      
        <p>in a car accident six months before,</p>
      
        <p>and when she was in college a year ago,</p>
      
        <p>she and her three college roommate went to strip club,</p>
      
        <p>and they were filming like a porn footage,</p>
      
        <p>like a background scene.</p>
      
        <p>So she's like extra watching strip club,</p>
      
        <p>and this is actually her last live footage.</p>
      
        <p>So dad's visiting from Canada.</p>
      
        <p>He would like to find it, because he obviously loved it,</p>
      
        <p>he obviously loved his daughter,</p>
      
        <p>and this is like the last thing, so, wanna find it.</p>
      
        <p>So I understand, I mean, I'm a pervert,</p>
      
        <p>but I'm not a monster, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, but here's the problem, there's 10,000 titles,</p>
      
        <p>even if I have a chance to check every single movie,</p>
      
        <p>fast forward, it would probably take me, honestly,</p>
      
        <p>a month, a month and a half.</p>
      
        <p>It's a lot of movie, but I gotta try, right?</p>
      
        <p>You still have to try.</p>
      
        <p>So 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m., 5, you know,</p>
      
        <p>all the movie I'm fast forwarding, I can't find it.</p>
      
        <p>You know, I'm looking at his daughter's picture, so,</p>
      
        <p>so 6 a.m., and his flight is 10 a.m.,</p>
      
        <p>I got desperate, so I call one of the customer, Cliff.</p>
      
        <p>He's been, you know, he's been shopping at Tapu</p>
      
        <p>for like 25 years.</p>
      
        <p>We call him Porn Yoda, because he's been,</p>
      
        <p>he's been watching porn for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>So we call then, he's very angry, he said,</p>
      
        <p>"'Goddamn, Yoshi, I told my wife I don't watch porn anymore.</p>
      
        <p>"'If she answers the phone, she's just gonna divorce me.</p>
      
        <p>"'You can't call me.'</p>
      
        <p>But I explained to Cliff, here's the situation.</p>
      
        <p>Well, Cliff have two daughters,</p>
      
        <p>so he understand, he wanna help too."</p>
      
        <p>So he said, did you check A, B, C, D, E, F, G,</p>
      
        <p>fetish section?</p>
      
        <p>Of course, I'm not stupid.</p>
      
        <p>So he said, did you check gay and bisexual section?</p>
      
        <p>I said, Cliff, did you hear me?</p>
      
        <p>We're looking for 20-year-old heterosexual girl.</p>
      
        <p>No, you don't understand, Yoshi.</p>
      
        <p>Most of the male strippers are gay,</p>
      
        <p>and they dance for ladies, and sometimes during the show,</p>
      
        <p>they suck each other off, and ladies like that.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't, I didn't know.</p>
      
        <p>So he said, go to the gay section.</p>
      
        <p>So I went to the gay section based on the box,</p>
      
        <p>and I noticed, I finally saw some of them</p>
      
        <p>were stripping, whatever.</p>
      
        <p>So I picked like 30 of them.</p>
      
        <p>So I started fast-forwarding.</p>
      
        <p>In 40 minutes, we found her.</p>
      
        <p>So that's the first story.</p>
      
        <p>So these are the pictures.</p>
      
        <p>And the reason I used this,</p>
      
        <p>we couldn't put a projector in here.</p>
      
        <p>So, so, you know, here's me working on this.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm like, okay, I'm gonna do this.</p>
      
        <p>I'm working in a porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>I watch a lot of porn.</p>
      
        <p>And the guy said, could you help my daughter?</p>
      
        <p>I mean, obviously, she's older than that.</p>
      
        <p>I talked to Porn Yoda right here.</p>
      
        <p>He said, go check that section.</p>
      
        <p>And luckily, we found the tape.</p>
      
        <p>Here's, okay, it wasn't a bear, but you get the idea.</p>
      
        <p>So I was so happy I was able to do this,</p>
      
        <p>because it's very rare when you work in sex shop,</p>
      
        <p>you could be nice.</p>
      
        <p>But you know, I'll be honest,</p>
      
        <p>I was really worried because for a second I thought,</p>
      
        <p>what happened, you know, in a movie, she get excited.</p>
      
        <p>You know, she started grabbing two dicks or something.</p>
      
        <p>You don't wanna see the dad, last scene of daughter,</p>
      
        <p>you know, doing this.</p>
      
        <p>Woo, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So that was a good experience.</p>
      
        <p>And I, and also, I watched so much porno that,</p>
      
        <p>to me, the kind of porn that you watch,</p>
      
        <p>if that tells me everything I need to know about you,</p>
      
        <p>it's like a credit report, right?</p>
      
        <p>And to me, most dangerous people on planet</p>
      
        <p>are Chinese and Chinese-American.</p>
      
        <p>Why?</p>
      
        <p>You know what kind of porn Chinese</p>
      
        <p>and Chinese-American people watch?</p>
      
        <p>They watch porno where they're fucking their bosses,</p>
      
        <p>or fucking at work.</p>
      
        <p>Or better yet, fucking their bosses at work.</p>
      
        <p>Why does that make them dangerous?</p>
      
        <p>Because even during the time of fantasy,</p>
      
        <p>Chinese people are thinking about work.</p>
      
        <p>That's fucking sick, let me tell you.</p>
      
        <p>I'm from Japan, we think about fucking our mother and sister</p>
      
        <p>having sex with tentacles, octopus porn,</p>
      
        <p>you know, getting peed on, or getting shit in our face,</p>
      
        <p>you know, normal stuff.</p>
      
        <p>And, uh.</p>
      
        <p>The blue girl.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I think.</p>
      
        <p>Cleveland, Singapore.</p>
