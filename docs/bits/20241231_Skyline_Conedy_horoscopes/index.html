        <p>Wouldn't it be better for everybody if there was just a simple thing to tell us how to live our lives?</p>
      
        <p>Wouldn't that be nice?</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, like horoscopes, for example.</p>
      
        <p>Like, make some noise if you believe in horoscopes.</p>
      
        <p>Horoscopes?</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Clearly a lot of shitty star signs in this room.</p>
      
        <p>No, because me, I'm a Leo.</p>
      
        <p>Greatest fucking star sign of all.</p>
      
        <p>Tom, are you a Leo?</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>Did I take back the brofist?</p>
      
        <p>Look, I think it's, you know, you're like everywhere too smart for horoscopes.</p>
      
        <p>I don't think the problem with horoscopes is that they seem stupid.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's because they're too generic, aren't they?</p>
      
        <p>Right.</p>
      
        <p>Like, if you read your horoscope on YouTube.</p>
      
        <p>You're gonna read horoscopes on your phone.</p>
      
        <p>It'll just say something like, like, today you will have a productive day.</p>
      
        <p>Like, that was just written by a chat GPT.</p>
      
        <p>Fuck yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, but I think the answer is we need to make horoscopes much more specific.</p>
      
        <p>Like, just imagine if you read your horoscope on your phone, it says, today you will be fucked by a horse.</p>
      
        <p>What the fuck?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And then if you're a boomer like me, you're gonna be fucked by a horse.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>happened to you sir? Oh I was just walking down the street sir. This fucking horse comes out of nowhere.</p>
      
        <p>And so Trevor your accent is really Scottish and Irish at the same time.</p>
      
        <p>And so how the fuck do you think you sound if you've just been fucked by a horse?</p>
      
        <p>Anyway guys that's me wrapping up with my message of hope, whatever happens I'm pretty sure no one here will get fucked by a horse.</p>
      
        <p>Bye!</p>
