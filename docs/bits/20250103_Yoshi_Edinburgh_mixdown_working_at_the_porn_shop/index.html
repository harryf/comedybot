        <p>so these are a couple of things that happened</p>
      
        <p>when I was working at the porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>And this is one of the first stories.</p>
      
        <p>So I think second month I was working there,</p>
      
        <p>this beautiful lady, she had a beautiful scarf,</p>
      
        <p>very elegant, but based on her skin tone,</p>
      
        <p>I thought she's from the Middle East or something.</p>
      
        <p>So she walked inside the sex shop,</p>
      
        <p>she went straight to BDSM section,</p>
      
        <p>like, wow, interesting choice.</p>
      
        <p>And then she started grabbing those whips,</p>
      
        <p>like two or three, very expensive, very powerful.</p>
      
        <p>And once she picked three,</p>
      
        <p>she walked up the counter and she's ready to pay for them.</p>
      
        <p>I said, I hope this is not an invasive question,</p>
      
        <p>but can I ask you like, where are you from?</p>
      
        <p>She's, oh, you can ask me anything.</p>
      
        <p>I'm from Saudi Arabia.</p>
      
        <p>So I asked, I've never been to Saudi Arabia,</p>
      
        <p>but I heard and read that compared to the West,</p>
      
        <p>they don't treat women very well.</p>
      
        <p>They don't give them very, too many options,</p>
      
        <p>tell them what to do, limit their movements.</p>
      
        <p>And if they commit small crime,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes they get beaten to death.</p>
      
        <p>So I thought, okay, let's do this.</p>
      
        <p>Let's get into that with whips.</p>
      
        <p>And here you are, you're buying whips,</p>
      
        <p>so I'm really, really confused, you know?</p>
      
        <p>And then this is what she said.</p>
      
        <p>Well, it's true, my country don't care about what I think.</p>
      
        <p>Don't give me very much option in life.</p>
      
        <p>And if I commit small crime, it could be my life.</p>
      
        <p>But you see, BDSM is one of the few things</p>
      
        <p>that they're always asking me.</p>
      
        <p>Are you comfortable?</p>
      
        <p>Does this feel good?</p>
      
        <p>Would you like to change your position?</p>
      
        <p>Would you like to stop?</p>
      
        <p>They really care about what I think and what I feel.</p>
      
        <p>And weirdly, it makes me happy.</p>
      
        <p>It gave me a little bit of love.</p>
      
        <p>And it gave me a little bit of self-dignity.</p>
      
        <p>I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting that answer.</p>
      
        <p>I thought because she got used to getting beaten</p>
      
        <p>that she wanted her husband to beat her up.</p>
      
        <p>That's what I thought.</p>
      
        <p>I think the reason this was so significant for me,</p>
      
        <p>just because something looks weird and painful to me,</p>
      
        <p>it doesn't mean that somebody else is finding happiness.</p>
      
        <p>So I shouldn't judge people.</p>
      
        <p>I should go and help them.</p>
      
        <p>So from that day on, I told her, I'm gonna do this.</p>
      
        <p>I'm gonna do this.</p>
      
        <p>I told myself, I don't work in porn business.</p>
      
        <p>I work in hospitality business.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>Because every day some person turn 18 years old,</p>
      
        <p>this is like late 90s, we didn't have Reddit.</p>
      
        <p>You didn't have chat room.</p>
      
        <p>There's a lot of kids, they don't have friends to talk to.</p>
      
        <p>They're afraid to talk to their parents.</p>
      
        <p>So only people that they could really talk is to come</p>
      
        <p>to sex shop and talk to a pervert.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So this kid walked in, clearly, I checked his age.</p>
      
        <p>He just turned 18.</p>
      
        <p>And I could tell he's gay, but very shy.</p>
      
        <p>He said, sir, could you help me find a really good gay porno?</p>
      
        <p>I said, of course.</p>
      
        <p>That's not a problem.</p>
      
        <p>The three best production company for gay movies are</p>
      
        <p>Falcon, Mustang, and Bellamy.</p>
      
        <p>And here's one, Jeff Stryker, performer of the year.</p>
      
        <p>He just got five dicks out of five dicks rating.</p>
      
        <p>So I think he should get this movie.</p>
      
        <p>So I gave it to him.</p>
      
        <p>He read the movie and he came back the next day.</p>
      
        <p>I was hoping that he's gonna be happy,</p>
      
        <p>but this is actually a little sad.</p>
      
        <p>He feels so ashamed that, you know, when you get sushi</p>
      
        <p>and you eat ginger, the reason why you eat ginger</p>
      
        <p>is wipe out the taste so you can eat the next sushi</p>
      
        <p>and get the whole flavor.</p>
      
        <p>So he feels so bad about getting gay rental</p>
      
        <p>that he got full heterosexual tape to cleanse</p>
      
        <p>whatever he did the day before.</p>
      
        <p>But I told him, his name's Eric,</p>
      
        <p>Eric, if you're gay, you should feel ashamed.</p>
      
        <p>You should accept who you are.</p>
      
        <p>If you wanna watch heterosexual tape, that's fine.</p>
      
        <p>We make more money, but don't rent it because you feel bad.</p>
      
        <p>You shouldn't feel bad at all.</p>
      
        <p>Gay people spend out for thousands of years, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So, and I'm 13 years older than him,</p>
      
        <p>but I was really shocked.</p>
      
        <p>He's so mature.</p>
      
        <p>You know when you watch television and movies,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes they have a gay character come out of a closet</p>
      
        <p>and they mention their family, there's a big issue.</p>
      
        <p>He wasn't worried about that.</p>
      
        <p>He was really worried if he told his parents,</p>
      
        <p>he was really worried because he didn't want his parents</p>
      
        <p>to think they did something bad.</p>
      
        <p>Because his parents gonna say, did we do something wrong?</p>
      
        <p>Or did we not raise him right?</p>
      
        <p>That's why he was afraid, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Isn't that mature?</p>
      
        <p>Because I would, I'll be honest, if I was gay,</p>
      
        <p>woo, you know, I'd get all the dicks, you know, right away.</p>
      
        <p>But, you know, two in my ass, whatever.</p>
      
        <p>But he's a good kid, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I learned.</p>
      
        <p>Now, there's times we have a really bad gay customer.</p>
      
        <p>I'll be honest with you.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, back in the day, for those of you that read VHS,</p>
      
        <p>if it's defective, we'll replace it.</p>
      
        <p>You know, sometimes we have a line across</p>
      
        <p>the middle of the movie, and of course we need to exchange.</p>
      
        <p>So this gay customer walked in, hey, I think,</p>
      
        <p>I need to, I wanna exchange this tape.</p>
      
        <p>There's a line across.</p>
      
        <p>So we play from beginning of the movie.</p>
      
        <p>So we fast forward, fast forward, one third, halfway,</p>
      
        <p>two third, all the way.</p>
      
        <p>There's no problem.</p>
      
        <p>There was never a problem.</p>
      
        <p>He want us to watch gay porno with him.</p>
      
        <p>He does this once a week.</p>
      
        <p>Every week, he'd say, oh, there's something wrong</p>
      
        <p>with my gay porno, and fast forward, we have to watch it.</p>
      
        <p>I know, and he know, and he know that I know</p>
      
        <p>that we playing the charade.</p>
      
        <p>But I can't say anything.</p>
