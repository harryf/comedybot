        <p>Do you guys remember what the question was?</p>
      
        <p>Can I do something?</p>
      
        <p>No, this is...</p>
      
        <p>You know one of my favorite things?</p>
      
        <p>You know one of my favorite things when I went to the porn shop?</p>
      
        <p>When I used to go to a porn convention in Vegas,</p>
      
        <p>and had this porn girl sign autographs for customers.</p>
      
        <p>And you know how...</p>
      
        <p>Because we have the internet.</p>
      
        <p>But back then, this was a huge thing.</p>
      
        <p>Like, Jinju Lin would say,</p>
      
        <p>Johnny, eat my ass.</p>
      
        <p>You know, they'd sign it.</p>
      
        <p>Or Janet James would say,</p>
      
        <p>Tony, let me suck your cock, whatever.</p>
      
        <p>These are average guys.</p>
      
        <p>They're never going to have access to women that look like that.</p>
      
        <p>It makes them happy.</p>
      
        <p>So I was more than happy to go and get autographed for them.</p>
      
        <p>But my...</p>
      
        <p>Some of my most uncomfortable ones was like,</p>
      
        <p>I had friends or customers.</p>
      
        <p>They're dying from cancer.</p>
      
        <p>So I would bring signed items.</p>
      
        <p>Or audio...</p>
      
        <p>Hey, you better beat that cancer.</p>
      
        <p>Because I'm going to fuck you in Vegas, Johnny.</p>
      
        <p>And things like that.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>This is the cruelest Make-A-Wish that I've ever heard.</p>
      
        <p>But Make-A-Wish is cruel because you know what's the first thing kids ask?</p>
      
        <p>Can you get rid of my cancer?</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, Johnny.</p>
      
        <p>We could give you a second option.</p>
      
        <p>But you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>It's really not about sex.</p>
      
        <p>Because, lady, I hate to tell you.</p>
      
        <p>Sex is overrun.</p>
      
        <p>It's overrated.</p>
      
        <p>Aw.</p>
      
        <p>We know that.</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>I said that with so much conviction.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Sex...</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>By now I know.</p>
      
        <p>Now my husband...</p>
      
        <p>Sex...</p>
      
        <p>Sex is absolutely overrated.</p>
      
        <p>And two, please don't think this is wrong, but beautiful women are like cockroaches.</p>
      
        <p>They're everywhere.</p>
      
        <p>The amount of time we think about sex and all the things, we're trying to get sex.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, you know what?</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to fuck you in Vegas.</p>
      
        <p>Bye.</p>
      
        <p>It's so disheartening.</p>
      
        <p>You know how many Hall of Fame perverts I know?</p>
      
        <p>And I talk to these guys, like, they're fucking 80s and 90s.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, it really bugs me.</p>
      
        <p>Like, do you still have this urges?</p>
      
        <p>Like, yeah, oh, my God.</p>
      
        <p>It's one of the few things that make me want to kill myself because I'm just sick of, like, those urges and stuff.</p>
