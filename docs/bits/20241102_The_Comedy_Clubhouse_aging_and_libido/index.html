        <p>Like, I recently turned 51.</p>
      
        <p>OK, that's about the right energy that I have.</p>
      
        <p>Being 51.</p>
      
        <p>And the thing is, is that you get to my age.</p>
      
        <p>Like, your body slowly starts to deteriorate.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, like recently I had this bad experience.</p>
      
        <p>Like, this vein in my eye just burst.</p>
      
        <p>It was like my eye just was like, I've seen enough.</p>
      
        <p>And then this vein in my eye just went, oh, no!</p>
      
        <p>What the fuck is happening to me?</p>
      
        <p>And that's how it is, guys.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>We're probably going to get bombed by ISIS for me doing that.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, but that's how it is.</p>
      
        <p>Like, some mornings I now wake up, there's like some random body part.</p>
      
        <p>Like, my knee will just be like, no.</p>
      
        <p>And then I just kind of like shuffle around like an idiot all day.</p>
      
        <p>The only part of my body that has any motivation left at this point is, of course, my penis.</p>
      
        <p>Now, this guy gets up every morning of 5 a.m.</p>
      
        <p>Like, he's read The Seven Habits of Hylia Lange.</p>
      
        <p>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
      
        <p>And then he just starts yelling at me.</p>
      
        <p>He starts going like, let's go!</p>
      
        <p>Let's get out there and slay some pussy.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, dude, what the fuck?</p>
      
        <p>It's 2024.</p>
      
        <p>Nobody's slaying pussy in 2024.</p>
      
        <p>It's like I got this teenage penis from the 1980s.</p>
      
        <p>Just wearing pink spandex and going like, hey, would you like a mixtape?</p>
      
        <p>It's fucked up.</p>
      
        <p>Look, I'm going to just finish on this.</p>
      
        <p>This is something.</p>
      
        <p>It's an important piece of information.</p>
      
        <p>I think this is something that we should teach men at school.</p>
      
        <p>And all of you young men here should know is that as you get older as a man,</p>
      
        <p>your pubic hair starts to grow down the shaft of your penis.</p>
      
        <p>Like hipsters moving into a vampire town.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, and I'll just wake up in the morning.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, fuck.</p>
      
        <p>There's a new coffee shop in the building.</p>
      
        <p>Oh my god.</p>
      
        <p>That's not good.</p>
      
        <p>And you can't go on a date with a lady with your dick looking like Wolverine.</p>
      
        <p>So I actually have to shave my dick.</p>
      
        <p>But the thing is, you can't shave your dick when it's soft because you'll give yourself</p>
      
        <p>a second circumcision.</p>
      
        <p>So I have to be like, shave, shave, shave.</p>
      
        <p>And a 50 year old dick is not easily gone.</p>
      
        <p>It's not easily pulled.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, I have to go back through every despicable act.</p>
      
        <p>Shave, shave, shave.</p>
      
        <p>So I can show up on that date and be like, oh my god, you look lovely tonight.</p>
      
        <p>All right, guys.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm doing a one hour show.</p>
