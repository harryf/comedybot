        <p>But yeah, it's that time of year, isn't it, like we've got these things hanging around, it's that time of year we like to celebrate old traditions, like Halloween and the US election.</p>
      
        <p>All the good American traditions.</p>
      
        <p>But you know, do any of you guys go to a Halloween party?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Gross.</p>
      
        <p>The way you said it, yeah, I mean, just, it's so sexy.</p>
      
        <p>No, I hate that, like, every time, because every time, like, they go like, Harry, what are you gonna wear?</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, I'm not, look, I'm just gonna come as me.</p>
      
        <p>I already look like Nosferatu.</p>
      
        <p>I mean.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not.</p>
      
        <p>I kind of want to unpack that laugh, right?</p>
      
        <p>I feel like that was a personal attack.</p>
      
        <p>But I like it.</p>
      
        <p>But no, the thing is, I got this message from this friend, and she invited me to a Halloween party.</p>
      
        <p>She invited me to a Halloween party.</p>
      
        <p>She sent this picture, and she said, look, look, Harry, this is a picture of me dressed as a witch with a broomstick.</p>
      
        <p>Now, guys, have you ever got into an argument?</p>
      
        <p>So dumb, you immediately regretted it.</p>
      
        <p>You ever had that happen?</p>
      
        <p>And I got then into an argument about witches and broomsticks.</p>
      
        <p>Because I then, with my stupid mouth, I said to her, oh, you do know where the tradition of witches and broomsticks comes from, right?</p>
      
        <p>She's like, no.</p>
      
        <p>I was like, well, back in the Middle Ages, they didn't have all the good drugs we have.</p>
      
        <p>So all they had was, like, plants and mushrooms.</p>
      
        <p>And most of those things, you put them in your mouth, that's like, that's like eating sour grapes.</p>
      
        <p>And then you put them in your mouth, that's like eating a sauerkraut with milk.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, ugh.</p>
      
        <p>So what they used to do is they used to take those drugs and put them in an ointment, and then smear that ointment on a broomstick.</p>
      
        <p>This man is the head of the game.</p>
      
        <p>And then they'd put that broomstick somewhere special.</p>
      
        <p>Wow, look at all the deaths of all these childbirths in the room.</p>
      
        <p>No, and seriously, this is a real thing.</p>
      
        <p>And my friend, and me, she got annoyed.</p>
      
        <p>She's like, Harry, just because you're old doesn't mean you can just make shit up and think I'll believe it.</p>
      
        <p>And then I got annoyed.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, just get on the internet.</p>
      
        <p>Ask ChatGPT.</p>
      
        <p>This is real.</p>
      
        <p>And then she's like, all right, Harry, Harry, listen, why a broomstick?</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, do you think they had dildos in the Middle Ages?</p>
      
        <p>Like, what better way to sip something far up your own ass than a broomstick?</p>
      
        <p>And then she's like, OK, look, Harry, this is not OK.</p>
      
        <p>Women have been persecuted for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>The whole witches and brooms.</p>
      
        <p>You're basically being a misogynist right now.</p>
      
        <p>I was like, wow.</p>
      
        <p>What a typical thing for a woman to say.</p>
      
        <p>My balls just went into my body.</p>
      
        <p>Wow, shit.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, clearly, do you think I'm right on this?</p>
      
        <p>OK, one or two.</p>
      
        <p>The rest of you.</p>
      
        <p>No, look, think about it.</p>
      
        <p>A broomstick is not a convenient mode of air transportation.</p>
      
        <p>Not even Ryanair would do that to you.</p>
      
        <p>Air lingers, you get a magic carpet.</p>
      
        <p>But no, look, here's how I think we came up with this myth.</p>
      
        <p>We came up with that myth because I think back in the Middle Ages, it was just that.</p>
      
        <p>And he gets up in the morning out of his straw bed.</p>
      
        <p>He's like, oh, my back hurts.</p>
      
        <p>We've got to invent a mattress.</p>
      
        <p>And then, and then, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And then, and then his kid comes running up to him and goes like, Daddy, Daddy, last night I saw mummy doing something with the broomstick.</p>
      
        <p>OK, let me help you visualize.</p>
      
        <p>Daddy, Daddy, last night I saw mummy doing this with the broomstick.</p>
      
        <p>You're very close to that, Sarah.</p>
      
        <p>I appreciate the vision.</p>
      
        <p>And then the dad's like, shit, what do I tell my kid?</p>
      
        <p>And the kid's like, what's she doing?</p>
      
        <p>He's like, she was learning to fly.</p>
      
        <p>She was learning to fly, darling.</p>
      
        <p>And then the kid's like, oh, my God, is mummy a witch?</p>
      
        <p>OK, that's not really a punchline, is it?</p>
