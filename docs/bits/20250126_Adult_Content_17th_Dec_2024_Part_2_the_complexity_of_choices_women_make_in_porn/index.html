        <p>And you just said they make...</p>
      
        <p>What?</p>
      
        <p>You just said something like,</p>
      
        <p>make a bad decision if women go into porn.</p>
      
        <p>Do you think it's a bad decision for women to go into porn?</p>
      
        <p>No, um...</p>
      
        <p>When I got into business,</p>
      
        <p>Canada wasn't a big thing,</p>
      
        <p>so I knew a lot of my friends were from Eastern Europe.</p>
      
        <p>You know, thinking back then was,</p>
      
        <p>they would film stuff in states,</p>
      
        <p>the chance of them getting copies in Eastern Europe,</p>
      
        <p>highly unlikely,</p>
      
        <p>and they come from very poor countries after the post-Cold War,</p>
      
        <p>so this was like once-in-life generation of wealth for a lot of them.</p>
      
        <p>So once from late...</p>
      
        <p>early 90s,</p>
      
        <p>they made so much money that they were able to go back to,</p>
      
        <p>you know, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania,</p>
      
        <p>and that money really changed their life for their families</p>
      
        <p>for the generations to come.</p>
      
        <p>So in situations like that,</p>
      
        <p>I think it's great,</p>
      
        <p>but I think when I see American girls,</p>
      
        <p>yeah, sometimes it's a money thing,</p>
      
        <p>but it's more complicated than that.</p>
      
        <p>And two, once you do porn, as you know,</p>
      
        <p>you can never go back.</p>
      
        <p>Like, people see you,</p>
      
        <p>but you know how difficult it is?</p>
      
        <p>Imagine you're 18,</p>
      
        <p>and you're not planning to go to school,</p>
      
        <p>to become a dentist,</p>
      
        <p>or whatever, you're an engineer,</p>
      
        <p>and whatnot,</p>
      
        <p>and you're making $1,500, $2,000 per scene,</p>
      
        <p>and three years later, you quit.</p>
      
        <p>You honestly think you could go work Starbucks at $8 an hour?</p>
      
        <p>This is a very, very difficult thing.</p>
      
        <p>And a lot of times,</p>
      
        <p>a lot of these girls worked for like eight,</p>
      
        <p>three, four, five, six years back then,</p>
      
        <p>and they fucking never paid taxes.</p>
      
        <p>Uncle Simon won their money,</p>
      
        <p>so they're getting in a bit of a financial situation, you know?</p>
      
        <p>I got an argument with him.</p>
      
        <p>I said,</p>
      
        <p>you know,</p>
      
        <p>there's a lot of people running the porn industry,</p>
      
        <p>like, there should be a retirement plan,</p>
      
        <p>post-porn programs to help them transition into,</p>
      
        <p>you know,</p>
      
        <p>unless they marry a rich guy.</p>
      
        <p>So I was really concerned for them,</p>
      
        <p>but it's a difficult thing.</p>
      
        <p>And now, with the OnlyFans and Instagram,</p>
      
        <p>it's a completely different business.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, it's hard for me to understand that new business,</p>
      
        <p>because they're not really porno.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I'm so old school,</p>
      
        <p>I love what they do.</p>
      
        <p>They're attention whores.</p>
      
        <p>And I just want to whore.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, wow.</p>
