        <p>I didn't know what to do, because I went in not knowing</p>
      
        <p>anything, and I just learned</p>
      
        <p>really hard way, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Because, um,</p>
      
        <p>you're great because,</p>
      
        <p>um, really,</p>
      
        <p>I say this with sincerity,</p>
      
        <p>I have two friends, Ogi Ogas</p>
      
        <p>and Asai Gadam, they wrote a book</p>
      
        <p>called A Billion Ways of Thought,</p>
      
        <p>and it's a book, it's such an amazing</p>
      
        <p>book, because it was written like 12, 13</p>
      
        <p>years ago, when, back then they had access</p>
      
        <p>to, uh, online search,</p>
      
        <p>and many of the search engines gave all the information.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>because traditional sex studies, you usually</p>
      
        <p>study somebody within your local, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like students, but if you only do</p>
      
        <p>research on students, it's not a very good</p>
      
        <p>sample. You wanna, you wanna</p>
      
        <p>have, because all you're doing, especially like 50s</p>
      
        <p>like with Kinsey and</p>
      
        <p>Master Johnson, you're only doing, uh,</p>
      
        <p>studies on like white, Anglo-Saxon</p>
      
        <p>group, but to truly</p>
      
        <p>give a big picture of how people</p>
      
        <p>really behave, there's only one area</p>
      
        <p>where people are completely honest, and you</p>
      
        <p>have a billion search, which is internet.</p>
      
        <p>And back then, when, uh, my friend</p>
      
        <p>Ogi did the research, it's illegal</p>
      
        <p>now, but he literally had billions</p>
      
        <p>and billions of internet search. Now,</p>
      
        <p>if I pick individually, I can't</p>
      
        <p>tell you what you're into, but if you have a</p>
      
        <p>billions of search, you did, you know there's a</p>
      
        <p>pattern that certain things are true, whether you're in</p>
      
        <p>Africa, Middle East, and Asia, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>so, but,</p>
      
        <p>he cannot no longer do study</p>
      
        <p>because his wife is</p>
      
        <p>a doctor</p>
      
        <p>from Saudi Arabia, they're just so embarrassed</p>
      
        <p>because they'd rather you do</p>
      
        <p>cognitive study about violence.</p>
      
        <p>That's normal. But as soon as you do sex,</p>
      
        <p>they're gonna call you fucking pervert,</p>
      
        <p>scumbag, and things like that, but</p>
      
        <p>honestly,</p>
      
        <p>you know, you live in an amazing place.</p>
      
        <p>Zurich, you have, was it Iceland?</p>
      
        <p>I was living in one of the cities, right?</p>
      
        <p>Think about all the discoveries</p>
      
        <p>in biology,</p>
      
        <p>chemistry, and physics in the last</p>
      
        <p>124 years.</p>
      
        <p>Unbelievable.</p>
      
        <p>You know the answer, not a whole lot of discoveries</p>
      
        <p>take so long because people are still embarrassed talking</p>
      
        <p>about it. So it takes someone like you,</p>
      
        <p>somebody with a social background,</p>
      
        <p>and ethical pervert</p>
      
        <p>myself.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>You know, you need an ethical pervert like myself</p>
      
        <p>because some of the</p>
      
        <p>greatest terrible things happen in this world,</p>
      
        <p>because you know, I've been to every one of those Jeffrey</p>
      
        <p>Epstein cases. I've been to all of them.</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>I went,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>so we're working at the porn shop, you know, like,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know how you would have handled it, but</p>
      
        <p>sometimes I have people walking, a lady walked in</p>
      
        <p>one time and was like, I fucked my son.</p>
      
        <p>She says this, right?</p>
      
        <p>She fucking walked out. Like, lady,</p>
      
        <p>you didn't even buy anything.</p>
      
        <p>That's pretty heavy.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean? It's my first night.</p>
      
        <p>Another guy comes,</p>
      
        <p>I fucked my stepdaughter, whatever.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I think, I don't know,</p>
      
        <p>I know that people have therapists, but this is kind of a little bit</p>
      
        <p>weird.</p>
      
        <p>Like, how do you tell them you have a certain</p>
      
        <p>finish? I don't think even they're kind of comfortable</p>
      
        <p>with that, right? So I didn't know</p>
      
        <p>sitting there, people are dumping the shit on me.</p>
      
        <p>Literally, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, um,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I, I,</p>
      
        <p>I, figuratively,</p>
      
        <p>figuratively, yes, but, um,</p>
      
        <p>or literally, I don't know, you tell me.</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>. .</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>like brian i don't i don't i don't feel comfortable um you know what i mean like i don't i don't feel</p>
      
        <p>comfortable doing this and and then yes you please like because because he he brought people right so</p>
      
        <p>he had to pay them no matter if they do sing on that so he's in the top so it's like three four</p>
      
        <p>thousand dollar scene it's like all right so like um um i don't know this is like 15 years ago so</p>
      
        <p>they're like i don't know five and eight years old like oh my god what i'm gonna do so i took</p>
      
        <p>them to mcdonald and and then um okay happy or something i don't know what to say to them</p>
      
        <p>i thought i talked to sex work but i don't know so anyway i was really uh uncomfortable because um</p>
      
        <p>the oldest girl was drinking vanilla milkshake</p>
      
        <p>and she broke and all the vanilla shake hit her face which is weird because her mom's doing the</p>
      
        <p>exact same thing and she's like oh my god i'm so sorry i didn't know that i was gonna do that</p>
      
        <p>and she's like oh my god i don't know why i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i didn't know that i was gonna do that</p>
      
        <p>same thing as uh as i speak</p>
      
        <p>right i mean i'm talking to me because i have i have to reconcile with two different ideas i have</p>
      
        <p>to be nice to the kid but like i'm a comedian and i'm working porn like yeah it's really really</p>
      
        <p>uncomfortable now that's not the part i was talking about</p>
      
        <p>so i've talked to chief and scene</p>
      
        <p>so i've talked to chief and scene she took a channel showed up pick up the kid</p>
      
        <p>i have to go um where they're filming that stuff so brandon having sex with a girl</p>
      
        <p>and afterwards there's like 25 30 guys you know it's like uh buccanti whatever and</p>
      
        <p>and so every time something like that happened you know there's a big puddle in the middle of the room</p>
      
        <p>right right somebody had to clean that you're looking at that guy so</p>
      
        <p>my job is two things i have to do two two five seven which is um um i'm sure i think i think</p>
      
        <p>you guys are way too young but in 1985 there was an incident in america there was a young woman</p>
      
        <p>named tracy lord one of the greatest performer and a famous porn star her</p>
      
        <p>late real name is norma coosman from ohio she was under age at the time</p>
      
        <p>she she had a bunch of fake ids she did a film and then ever since then to protect young people from</p>
      
        <p>from during porn, we have this thing called 2257 where you have to show two IDs to prove</p>
      
        <p>that you're 18 years older. So my job is to show up after the blow bang scene to make</p>
      
        <p>sure that they're 18 years old, which is fine. I just don't like after the thing, these guys</p>
      
        <p>might shake my hand. I don't want to fucking shake your hand. Go away, right? So as soon</p>
      
        <p>as I check that 2257, they're 18, they get the paycheck, they're paid. Okay, after I'm done,</p>
      
        <p>I have to do the cleanup. This is how dumb I am. I thought, because it's just like all this</p>
      
        <p>fucking liquid, you know, that if I were to really hide boots, I'm away from the problem, right?</p>
