        <p>Hell yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you...</p>
      
        <p>See, see, as I see...</p>
      
        <p>Why is it hard if the tram goes the wrong way?</p>
      
        <p>How did you make me laugh so hard with that question?</p>
      
        <p>Like, like...</p>
      
        <p>In America, if the parent gives permission, kids could get married at a young age,</p>
      
        <p>provided they get permission from both parents, they could get married underage.</p>
      
        <p>So, if you could do that, and if the kid is dying,</p>
      
        <p>and it's just like, just because we feel uncomfortable, I think it's wrong to let them die.</p>
      
        <p>And if that's what they really want to do before they're dead, I think it's wrong not to do it.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's wrong to do that for them.</p>
      
        <p>It's coming from a good place, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Just because we feel uncomfortable...</p>
      
        <p>So you should let somebody suck his dick because he might suck the cancer out of him, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>Is this wrong?</p>
      
        <p>It's a good thing he's not here because otherwise he would be like,</p>
      
        <p>I have cancer.</p>
      
        <p>And somebody asked me, how would you feel if your son is dying from cancer, and he's gay?</p>
      
        <p>This is the kind of father I am.</p>
      
        <p>The biggest pain is black gay cock for my son, right?</p>
      
        <p>I'll stretch my son's ass wide open.</p>
      
        <p>But you don't fuck my son, right?</p>
      
        <p>Because I'm homophobic.</p>
      
        <p>If my son's gay and dying, then I think that's only a good father would do that.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, I think about this shit every fucking day.</p>
      
        <p>So you send your son...</p>
      
        <p>It's funny that I do this, but...</p>
      
        <p>If my shitty DNA gave my son cancer, I think that's the very least I should do.</p>
      
        <p>Any questions right now?</p>
      
        <p>Any questions from here?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, please.</p>
      
        <p>We're recording this, this is why.</p>
      
        <p>So you said you went to many different countries, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like Sweden...</p>
      
        <p>Afghanistan...</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah, check this.</p>
      
        <p>So do you see any countries that are more open?</p>
      
        <p>That are generally...</p>
      
        <p>That they have a culture that is...</p>
      
        <p>This is an excellent question.</p>
      
        <p>And based on all the places I have been to,</p>
      
        <p>in my personal opinion,</p>
      
        <p>women who are the most confident, and they're very honest, and they're assertive,</p>
      
        <p>and they have a happy sex life,</p>
      
        <p>in my opinion,</p>
      
        <p>I have to go into all those places,</p>
      
        <p>it's Dutch women.</p>
      
        <p>Because I notice most countries, I do...</p>
      
        <p>Hugo is Dutch.</p>
      
        <p>Oh!</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, I've never had a Dutch girlfriend.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not a Dutch woman.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why I find the Netherlands to be an amazing place,</p>
      
        <p>it's because most countries have one thing, but not both.</p>
      
        <p>So if prostitution is legal, porn is illegal.</p>
      
        <p>If porn is legal, prostitution is legal.</p>
      
        <p>Or worse scenario, they're both legal.</p>
      
        <p>But Netherlands have both of those things.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not suggesting having porn necessarily means a good thing,</p>
      
        <p>but what I think it is,</p>
      
        <p>you have a society where you give women the freedom to make a bad decision to do porn.</p>
      
        <p>See, more freedom, more choices for women is a better way.</p>
      
        <p>And because of the sex education in the Netherlands,</p>
      
        <p>that's one thing I noticed,</p>
      
        <p>they're very confident and assertive, you know,</p>
      
        <p>and I really like how parents approach sex,</p>
      
        <p>and like education,</p>
      
        <p>and with a lot of pragmatism, you know.</p>
      
        <p>But having said that,</p>
      
        <p>the country that really shocked me in terms of their aggressiveness,</p>
      
        <p>every time I talk to my porn guys,</p>
      
        <p>which particular regional country where women are contacted,</p>
      
        <p>for sex,</p>
      
        <p>it's really surprising,</p>
      
        <p>it's always India, Pakistan, and the Bangladesh area.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why that is,</p>
