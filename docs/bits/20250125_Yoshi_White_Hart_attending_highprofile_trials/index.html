        <p>Then they want to...</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>And somebody asked me recently, like,</p>
      
        <p>how would you feel if your son is dying from cancer and he's gay?</p>
      
        <p>And he went with his virginity.</p>
      
        <p>I'll be honest, I'm a little conservative.</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to have a gay-sion for a son.</p>
      
        <p>But if my son is dying from cancer because of my shitty genetic,</p>
      
        <p>this is the kind of father I am, sir.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to get the biggest Spanish black gay cock</p>
      
        <p>for my son.</p>
      
        <p>I will personally help Jamal lose an enormous black cock</p>
      
        <p>in the world, right?</p>
      
        <p>Only fair.</p>
      
        <p>And I'll spread my dying son's ass wide open.</p>
      
        <p>It's a big, big rice hole, right?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, you should fuck underage kids, but there's time.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>It's a good thing, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Fuck my son, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I think...</p>
      
        <p>You know, I'm not coming back for another five years, so...</p>
      
        <p>So, last thing.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      
        <p>I hope, you know, I do like an hour of this.</p>
      
        <p>That's all right.</p>
      
        <p>I believe we didn't like that ending in Morocco.</p>
      
        <p>So last one is, thank you for listening.</p>
      
        <p>I just want to let you know, I have a really weird hobby.</p>
      
        <p>I was one of the four people in the room</p>
      
        <p>when Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty, verdict.</p>
      
        <p>I was also there for sentencing.</p>
      
        <p>Harvey Weinstein, Trump's gays, Elizabeth Holmes, Danny Maxwell.</p>
      
        <p>So I call any six...</p>
      
        <p>I just got back from France when that lady got...</p>
      
        <p>Giselle Petticoat, she was raped by her husband.</p>
      
        <p>Oh.</p>
      
        <p>I was actually...</p>
      
        <p>Oh, yeah, right.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, I was there.</p>
      
        <p>And...</p>
      
        <p>In Maineport, I'm moving Southern District for Diddy's case.</p>
      
        <p>I won't be there.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, the reason I say this,</p>
      
        <p>because sex is a very difficult subject matter,</p>
      
        <p>when these very powerful men,</p>
      
        <p>mostly men and women, running the world,</p>
      
        <p>they do all kinds of terrible things with sex,</p>
      
        <p>and because everyone is afraid to talk about this,</p>
      
        <p>we allow these people to behave this way.</p>
      
        <p>So that's why...</p>
      
        <p>I'm kind of really obsessed.</p>
      
        <p>But I'll finish with...</p>
      
        <p>In France, I didn't know...</p>
      
        <p>Did you know, except for her husband,</p>
      
        <p>all 50 other rapists were not kept in jail.</p>
      
        <p>So every day they have to walk into court.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know that.</p>
      
        <p>I don't think...</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know.</p>
      
        <p>You know, I don't know how that works.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, French rapists, you know, sounds redundant, but...</p>
      
        <p>But last one is, because I saw this rapist walking,</p>
      
        <p>I thought...</p>
      
        <p>Because, you know, when I opened this porn shop,</p>
      
        <p>I used to beat the shit out of...</p>
      
        <p>Crackheads, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
      
        <p>They're collecting.</p>
      
        <p>And I know where to stand in the store</p>
      
        <p>where the camera can't hit me,</p>
      
        <p>so sometimes when the crackheads walk in,</p>
      
        <p>they'll fly across because I just hit them with a baseball bat.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>So what I did in France,</p>
      
        <p>every time I look over the shoulder,</p>
      
        <p>I saw a couple of those rapists come in,</p>
      
        <p>because they're covered, right?</p>
      
        <p>I kind of time it,</p>
      
        <p>and as soon as they get...</p>
      
        <p>I kind of elbow,</p>
      
        <p>and I hit a couple of those rapists.</p>
      
        <p>I got one guy in the face,</p>
      
        <p>and another guy in the chest.</p>
      
        <p>I don't speak French, but, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I just...</p>
      
        <p>I just do that ching-chong,</p>
      
        <p>and then they...</p>
      
        <p>I say something Chinese,</p>
      
        <p>something...</p>
      
        <p>They can't get mad at an Asian.</p>
      
        <p>I was the only Asian guy there.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>So I don't feel bad about hitting rapists.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>I made a mistake.</p>
      
        <p>The third person,</p>
      
        <p>I timed it.</p>
      
        <p>Somehow, when I looked,</p>
      
        <p>I timed it.</p>
      
        <p>As soon as I was ready to hit,</p>
      
        <p>this lady caught off the rapist,</p>
      
        <p>so when I elbow her,</p>
      
        <p>I...</p>
      
        <p>I hit this lady big tits in her chest</p>
      
        <p>really fucking hard, right?</p>
      
        <p>After that, I stopped doing it.</p>
      
        <p>The reason I stopped,</p>
      
        <p>even though I want to hit the rapist,</p>
      
        <p>my Japanese friend,</p>
      
        <p>why did you stop?</p>
      
        <p>Just hit other people,</p>
      
        <p>just being careful.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Can you imagine a scenario</p>
      
        <p>where I can make a mistake?</p>
      
        <p>So I hit the number one rapist,</p>
      
        <p>number two rapist,</p>
      
        <p>third one lady.</p>
      
        <p>Let's say I make a mistake,</p>
      
        <p>fourth and fifth and sixth,</p>
      
        <p>I miss,</p>
      
        <p>and I keep hitting women.</p>
      
        <p>Can you imagine, sir?</p>
      
        <p>There's only one Asian guy.</p>
      
        <p>All of a sudden,</p>
      
        <p>this Asian guy's just</p>
      
        <p>elbowing innocent women</p>
      
        <p>in like a face and tits, right?</p>
      
        <p>So that's why I stopped.</p>
      
        <p>So I have good intention,</p>
      
        <p>but sometimes when you make it</p>
      
        <p>over a better place,</p>
      
        <p>you gotta hit a couple of those big titties.</p>
      
        <p>All right, guys.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very much,</p>
      
        <p>and hopefully it gives some fun.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, that was a little weird show.</p>
      
        <p>Please give it a raise.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
