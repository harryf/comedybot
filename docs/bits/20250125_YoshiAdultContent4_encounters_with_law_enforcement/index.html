        <p>he'll put a pumpkin on top of his dick.</p>
      
        <p>Christmas time, he puts Santa Claus</p>
      
        <p>up on his dick, right?</p>
      
        <p>And of course,</p>
      
        <p>9-11, he would put</p>
      
        <p>NYPD blue helmet on top of his dick.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I love my country, so I</p>
      
        <p>salute the dick. So anyway,</p>
      
        <p>but something about my personality,</p>
      
        <p>people keep sending me dick pictures,</p>
      
        <p>you know, and</p>
      
        <p>I don't like it.</p>
      
        <p>I tell them to</p>
      
        <p>stop. Alright.</p>
      
        <p>Alright.</p>
      
        <p>One time,</p>
      
        <p>but, you know,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>there's been times when pornography</p>
      
        <p>kind of saved my life.</p>
      
        <p>One year,</p>
      
        <p>you know, my dad passed away</p>
      
        <p>and my cousin passed away within a week,</p>
      
        <p>so I was not in a good mood, and I was</p>
      
        <p>going up to Seattle for my cousin's funeral,</p>
      
        <p>and I took</p>
      
        <p>their own bag, and airport,</p>
      
        <p>I had a weapon in my bag,</p>
      
        <p>I completely forgot. You know, you know what?</p>
      
        <p>Collapsible batonius, like a stick, you go like this,</p>
      
        <p>it becomes big. So like, it's</p>
      
        <p>kind of, you know, I used to work in porn,</p>
      
        <p>and it got robbed, so I have that.</p>
      
        <p>And,</p>
      
        <p>and, uh, I don't know if you could see, but I had, like,</p>
      
        <p>I got, you know,</p>
      
        <p>attacked by homeless people at the shop. Anyway,</p>
      
        <p>so I had a weapon in my bag, right?</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>I get arrested on September 11, 2003.</p>
      
        <p>So they think I'm a terrorist because I have a weapon in my bag, right?</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know how it is in prison, in jail, in Switzerland, I'm sure it's the lines, so they're not.</p>
      
        <p>Here, here's the thing.</p>
      
        <p>Here's the problem.</p>
      
        <p>When they took me to jail, that's the first time I went to jail.</p>
      
        <p>It's really scary for me because</p>
      
        <p>if you go to the American prison system,</p>
      
        <p>it's basically, you have to go into your group.</p>
      
        <p>So all the blacks are over there,</p>
      
        <p>all the Latino and all the white people.</p>
      
        <p>Here's the problem. Asian people don't commit crime.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm in a corner with</p>
      
        <p>a Samoan guy</p>
      
        <p>in a man in a women's outfit.</p>
      
        <p>That's my team, right?</p>
      
        <p>There's just three of us.</p>
      
        <p>There's hundreds of black people over here.</p>
      
        <p>Hundreds of Latino and hundreds of,</p>
      
        <p>and I'm just, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know how to fight.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I look, I'm Asian, so I look like I know how to fight.</p>
      
        <p>But, I mean,</p>
      
        <p>So I'm panicking, like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, I just think every prison is like,</p>
      
        <p>oh my god, I'm gonna get raped, right?</p>
      
        <p>And, uh,</p>
      
        <p>Why am I afraid of that?</p>
      
        <p>You know, I'm afraid I might enjoy it.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, so I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I've never been, I don't know what's gonna happen.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm really nervous.</p>
      
        <p>And then, uh, this black guy</p>
      
        <p>walked up to me, right? Like, oh no.</p>
      
        <p>Because I don't know if you know, there's been friction between</p>
      
        <p>Asians and black people in Los Angeles</p>
      
        <p>for a while. So I thought, oh my god, I'm gonna have a problem.</p>
      
        <p>And he goes, hey bro,</p>
      
        <p>where did you get that t-shirt, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I forgot, I'm wearing the Porn Company</p>
      
        <p>t-shirt.</p>
      
        <p>So, on my</p>
      
        <p>t-shirt, it has Adventures of</p>
      
        <p>Buttman, right?</p>
      
        <p>Just like,</p>
      
        <p>I'm a little scared because</p>
      
        <p>you don't want to be known as</p>
      
        <p>Buttman in jail, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>That's, I was so scared</p>
      
        <p>I didn't even pay anything.</p>
      
        <p>So I had a Buttman.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, this is where it saved me. I said, oh,</p>
      
        <p>because I work for this company,</p>
      
        <p>isn't it interesting, usually</p>
      
        <p>they hate Asian people in jail,</p>
      
        <p>the white, blacks, and Latinos.</p>
      
        <p>But this is one thing,</p>
      
        <p>there's one thing that you can overcome, racism,</p>
      
        <p>which is perversity.</p>
      
        <p>Like, if you're pervert,</p>
      
        <p>sorry, I don't know why I keep looking at you, but anyway,</p>
      
        <p>Objection, you hold on.</p>
      
        <p>If you're pervert, people kind of</p>
      
        <p>overlook the difference, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Because, for anybody who's from</p>
      
        <p>here, from Germany,</p>
      
        <p>they have the biggest convention in Europe called Venus Fair</p>
      
        <p>in Berlin. So every October, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I think the first time I went was</p>
      
        <p>2002, and</p>
      
        <p>look, I don't like</p>
      
        <p>stripes and all, I want people to get along,</p>
      
        <p>but it's interesting, it's the biggest</p>
      
        <p>porn in Europe,</p>
      
        <p>on Venus Fair,</p>
      
        <p>and this is the one time, it's amazing,</p>
      
        <p>it's wonderful, because people who</p>
      
        <p>traditionally hate each other, because there's a bunch</p>
      
        <p>of naked women running around,</p>
      
        <p>they're getting along. So like,</p>
      
        <p>black and white people are getting along,</p>
      
        <p>Jews and Muslims are getting along,</p>
      
        <p>Japanese with other Asian</p>
      
        <p>people, you know what I mean? Like, people that usually hate,</p>
      
        <p>because it's hard to be</p>
      
        <p>angry when you see tits and asses, right?</p>
      
        <p>It's really hard. You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I think, maybe in</p>
      
        <p>Palestine, Jews, if they had a, you know,</p>
      
        <p>if naked people walked down the street,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean, sir? You know what I mean? Like, you have a bad day,</p>
