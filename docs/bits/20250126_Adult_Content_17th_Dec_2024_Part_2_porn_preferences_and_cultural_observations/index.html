        <p>Any other questions in the room, right now?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, you're like this.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my. That was a good one.</p>
      
        <p>Do you know who I think is the most</p>
      
        <p>dangerous people on the planet?</p>
      
        <p>It's based on what kind of porn they watch.</p>
      
        <p>In my opinion, the most dangerous people</p>
      
        <p>on the planet are Chinese people.</p>
      
        <p>Because Chinese people watch the same kind of porn</p>
      
        <p>all the time.</p>
      
        <p>The porn that they like, based on</p>
      
        <p>what the customer has, Chinese people like</p>
      
        <p>watching porn where people are</p>
      
        <p>working... they're fucking</p>
      
        <p>at work.</p>
      
        <p>Or they're fucking their bosses.</p>
      
        <p>Or they're doing the phone...</p>
      
        <p>...</p>
      
        <p>This is really sick. Even in a fantasy time,</p>
      
        <p>Chinese people are thinking about work.</p>
      
        <p>That's fucking...</p>
      
        <p>That's really fucking sick.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, Japanese people think about</p>
      
        <p>fucking their moms or whatever.</p>
      
        <p>Or, you know, Mexicans work hard</p>
      
        <p>but they think of two women. Chinese people</p>
      
        <p>always wanna like...</p>
      
        <p>I've seen a couple porn where they're getting fucked</p>
      
        <p>and she's still doing calculations.</p>
      
        <p>How much do you have to work?</p>
      
        <p>That's why they're dominating the whole world.</p>
      
        <p>That rocket is not going to the moon.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah, so...</p>
      
        <p>But yeah, it's...</p>
      
        <p>Honestly, I'm not...</p>
      
        <p>You know, somebody asked me what's my fantasy,</p>
      
        <p>right? Like you were saying?</p>
      
        <p>One of my fantasies is...</p>
      
        <p>Did you know when they killed</p>
      
        <p>Bin Laden,</p>
      
        <p>they found two laptops</p>
      
        <p>and a regular computer,</p>
      
        <p>they found a bunch of porn in there.</p>
      
        <p>Here's my fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>I pray to God, one of the porn that he was watching</p>
      
        <p>is the movie I made.</p>
      
        <p>My movie's so good,</p>
      
        <p>he's jacking off like,</p>
      
        <p>you know,</p>
      
        <p>and...</p>
      
        <p>As a niggie, she was walking up the stairs,</p>
      
        <p>he's jacking off to my movie,</p>
      
        <p>and we get him killed</p>
      
        <p>because of my porn.</p>
      
        <p>That's my fantasy right there.</p>
      
        <p>Two shots for one.</p>
      
        <p>But, um...</p>
      
        <p>I wrote the U.S. government</p>
      
        <p>like,</p>
      
        <p>did you give me less the porn than Bin Laden?</p>
      
        <p>They won't give it to you. It's classified.</p>
      
        <p>It's classified.</p>
      
        <p>I have one more question because</p>
      
        <p>a lot of people</p>
      
        <p>these days get in trouble when they watch</p>
      
        <p>porn at work. Now, you</p>
      
        <p>have to watch porn at work. What would you get in trouble for?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, so my workstation when I was working,</p>
      
        <p>like, um...</p>
      
        <p>Imagine you watch porn</p>
      
        <p>eight to ten hours, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like, I get sick of it. You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I really used to...</p>
      
        <p>Steve, I used to</p>
      
        <p>love watching Pixar movies.</p>
      
        <p>One time... Like your kids?</p>
      
        <p>I love Pixar movies.</p>
      
        <p>And a lot of the porn guys like Pixar movies, too.</p>
      
        <p>And a lot of the porn guys</p>
      
        <p>like Toy Story because</p>
      
        <p>obviously the main character is named</p>
      
        <p>Woody.</p>
      
        <p>But one time,</p>
      
        <p>I'm in San Diego, we were phoning</p>
      
        <p>like, I don't know, like</p>
      
        <p>Gang Bang or something. So I was there to help them film that.</p>
      
        <p>And then</p>
      
        <p>weekends when you're driving back from San Diego to LA,</p>
      
        <p>the traffic is terrible. So I</p>
      
        <p>pulled over and like,</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to take six hours to go home.</p>
      
        <p>So every time I stop driving</p>
      
        <p>out of San Diego back to LA,</p>
      
        <p>I go to a movie theater, you know, watch a movie</p>
      
        <p>or something to kill me. So I remember</p>
      
        <p>one time, I watched every movie</p>
      
        <p>except the movie Ratatouille.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm sitting there, right? I don't... That one was stupid.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I thought? I thought it was like a gangster movie.</p>
      
        <p>A bunch of rats or something.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, I'm watching, right?</p>
      
        <p>And like, this is so stupid.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really embarrassed. I'm really embarrassed</p>
      
        <p>to say this. So that was like 2007.</p>
