        <p>You totally can.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of weird thinking, oh God, this is such a terrible.</p>
      
        <p>Wait, wait.</p>
      
        <p>I can layer in it because you know in Pornhub it shows you the peaks of where everybody watched.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And there's this little, they give you a sign where you've grown.</p>
      
        <p>That's it?</p>
      
        <p>Because I look at a lot of Pornhub.</p>
      
        <p>I did in my class.</p>
      
        <p>You know when my friend.</p>
      
        <p>Is that validating as well?</p>
      
        <p>What?</p>
      
        <p>Where you go like I picked that point and the curve shows that was the right moment.</p>
      
        <p>The front is the stop.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, I see what you're saying.</p>
      
        <p>I don't really watch a lot of Pornhub stuff.</p>
      
        <p>You know, but.</p>
      
        <p>Wait, are you like that guy that talks about music?</p>
      
        <p>It's like, oh, I only listen to LPs.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>Streaming porn, that's for losers.</p>
      
        <p>I need VHS.</p>
      
        <p>I need it rough.</p>
      
        <p>Like sandy and grainy.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, that was the porn stars.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>You have the look.</p>
      
        <p>You know how difficult it is sometimes.</p>
      
        <p>If you're a person into certain fetish, it's not available.</p>
      
        <p>So they ask questions like, am I fucking weird?</p>
      
        <p>And they don't want to do it.</p>
      
        <p>Or somebody hasn't made.</p>
      
        <p>Part of the job for me working in the Pornhub is not making anybody feel really bad.</p>
      
        <p>What they want, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And this is such a really weird one.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I had a lady come in.</p>
      
        <p>She was probably in her 70s, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, and, you know, she was like, oh, I'm going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to do this.</p>
      
        <p>She was trying to get.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, imagine if you never watched porn and never been to Pornhub.</p>
      
        <p>It's got to be a little overwhelming because there's thousands, thousands of porn, you</p>
      
        <p>know.</p>
      
        <p>And I talked to her.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I like because I work at midnight.</p>
      
        <p>You know, I have so much time talking to people.</p>
      
        <p>And eventually I got to know her.</p>
      
        <p>Basically, her husband just passed away.</p>
      
        <p>And they didn't really have an honest kind of healthy sex life.</p>
      
        <p>And, really, it's a little weird for me to talk to somebody 40 years older than me, old</p>
      
        <p>enough to be my grandmother.</p>
      
        <p>She also survived.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why I love her.</p>
      
        <p>She survived Holocaust too, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, she's from that generation.</p>
      
        <p>She had a very traumatic life.</p>
      
        <p>And surviving is a big thing.</p>
      
        <p>And sex talk was.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, you got to go gentle, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like fisting.</p>
      
        <p>You don't put the whole thing in.</p>
      
        <p>You go one finger, two fingers.</p>
      
        <p>Eventually, one of the.</p>
      
        <p>So, I got her like, oh, you know, if you want to.</p>
      
        <p>Behind the green door, this was made in 67, 68, classic.</p>
      
        <p>It's classier, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And then after that, I helped her get toys and things like that, you know, because as</p>
      
        <p>much it was uncomfortable for me.</p>
      
        <p>She come from the generation, like, you can't even talk about orgasm and things like that,</p>
      
        <p>you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, to me, there's things I believe in porn that I don't believe in.</p>
      
        <p>There's things I believe in porn that I'm really wrong looking back.</p>
      
        <p>That most of the porn, I mean, it has changed the last 10 years, but for a long time, it</p>
      
        <p>was a male-dominant, only one of pleased men.</p>
      
        <p>We didn't really factor in that women have a right to have fantasy orgasm too, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, it was accidental.</p>
      
        <p>So, I ended up helping her.</p>
      
        <p>And I think six or seven months to the point where she was comfortable doing porno stuff</p>
      
        <p>and toys, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Like, it's just progression about her getting comfortable.</p>
      
        <p>And I think I stopped seeing her because I think even though she was late 60s and early</p>
      
        <p>70s, I don't want to say I had a big reason, but I think she started dating, you know, at</p>
      
        <p>that age.</p>
      
        <p>Of course.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Because I think orgasm and sexual rights, I think this is a human right, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And I think because it's so difficult to talk about, they come to pornography.</p>
      
        <p>And look, go to country that, go to country where pornography is legal, I'll bet you,</p>
      
        <p>women are not treated very well.</p>
      
        <p>Because what we're saying is, even porn is bad, we give freedom for women to make a decision</p>
