        <p>But you,</p>
      
        <p>so I'm trying to reconcile two things,</p>
      
        <p>like,</p>
      
        <p>I miss my dad.</p>
      
        <p>He died in a really terrible circumstance.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't want to think about it.</p>
      
        <p>He cut me off crying.</p>
      
        <p>This kid's hand over.</p>
      
        <p>And that's the,</p>
      
        <p>that's the amazing thing about kids.</p>
      
        <p>They see good in everyone.</p>
      
        <p>And anybody who were porn,</p>
      
        <p>everybody's a scumbag, right?</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>I forgot to tell you this during the story,</p>
      
        <p>because one time my friend Brandon Iron,</p>
      
        <p>he's a porn star from Canada,</p>
      
        <p>he called me.</p>
      
        <p>help me with something. I thought he needs camera guy. So this one, he's gonna fuck this</p>
      
        <p>girl and afterward there's like 15 to 20 guy blow bang. Blow bang is where 20 guys put</p>
      
        <p>their dick and just come on her face, right? It's kind of similar to Bukkake, which is</p>
      
        <p>Japanese word. But anyway, so I said, well, if you don't need camera man, what do you</p>
      
        <p>need? So here's the scenario. The girl has two daughters and the babysitter flaked on</p>
      
        <p>them. So they need me babysitting those two girls, five and seven. I said, Brandon, I</p>
      
        <p>don't feel comfortable, but even they don't shoot, he had to pay all these people. It's</p>
      
        <p>like $5,000 to go down the toilet. He can find it. But so I show up, take the two kids</p>
      
        <p>to McDonald's, you know, like they're white kids. What am I doing with white kids? I'm</p>
      
        <p>just like, okay.</p>
      
        <p>Please don't ask me questions. And then I get the food and all this daughter is sloppy.</p>
      
        <p>She's drinking vanilla milkshake. She had a banana shake all over her face, which is</p>
      
        <p>ironic. The same thing is happening to mom as we speak. I had to reconcile. Do you know,</p>
      
        <p>see, if you go to Japan.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I'm not saying that I'm not a big fan of Japanese people. But I think Japanese</p>
      
        <p>people, bukkake, they don't think sex. That's like something that most foreigners think.</p>
      
        <p>But for those of you, if you don't know what, bukkake is a type of noodle. And they give</p>
      
        <p>you a little bit of sauce. So it's just enough to spread across their face. That's why when</p>
      
        <p>you do bukkake film, all the guy's ejaculating on the guy's, girl's face, you know, to spread.</p>
      
        <p>That's why it's called bukkake film. But bukkake, 95% of Japanese people said, type of noodle.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of funny.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm like, okay, I'm going to go to Japan. I'm going to go to Japan. I'm going to go to</p>
      
        <p>Tokyo. I'm going to go to Tokyo. I'm going to go to Tokyo. I'm going to go to Tokyo. I'm</p>
      
        <p>going to go to Tokyo. I'm going to go to Tokyo. I'm going to go to Tokyo. I'm going</p>
      
        <p>to go to Tokyo. I'm going to go to Tokyo.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of funny. But two people just walking, and I'm talking about a fucking game. Sorry.</p>
      
        <p>All right. This is actually just the moment where we're going to wrap it up. I have time</p>
      
        <p>for one more question to do. Anyone? Any takers?</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>Was this show weird? Did I waste your time? Is there a complaint? Is there something</p>
      
        <p>that you want to hear more or less of? Because I don't know what you guys are thinking.</p>
      
        <p>I have one question.</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>How many people did you see this show?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>How much confidence, or should I say, how did you get into the position to talk in</p>
      
        <p>front of people? Everybody's watching you. Especially in case of humor, which is quite</p>
      
        <p>individual.</p>
      
        <p>This is actually very good.</p>
      
        <p>This is actually a good question. I told them beginning the show something happened. My</p>
      
        <p>mom was basically... My mother was forced to marry my dad. And I had a very difficult</p>
      
        <p>relationship. And I hate to say it, but I overheard my mom talking to her friend one</p>
      
        <p>time drunk, because I sneak met her on that downstairs. You know what she said to her</p>
      
        <p>friend? I shouldn't be laughing, but...</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>She said one time, every time she sees my face, she wants to kill herself.</p>
      
        <p>Aww.</p>
      
        <p>You're beautiful.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>It's fine. I mean, it's kind of funny now, but at the time, I didn't really take it that</p>
      
        <p>way. But I think...</p>
      
        <p>I think... But anyway, I think when you're a comedian, I think you probably grow up</p>
      
        <p>in a very secure situation. And maybe we didn't grow up with people who were very, very, very</p>
      
        <p>good at listening skills. We didn't grow up with people with good listening skills. So</p>
      
        <p>to have anybody listen, it really is a privilege, you know? So I try to give... I try to be as</p>
      
        <p>authentic as I can and try to tell them hopefully a meaningful story to make connection with</p>
      
        <p>people, you know? But sometimes it's hard because, you know, 2019, my friend Brody,</p>
      
        <p>comedian guy, he killed himself hanging. And my friend Brandon Iron, porn guy, he killed</p>
      
        <p>himself hanging. And my friend Brandon Iron, porn guy, he killed himself hanging. And my</p>
      
        <p>dad killed himself by hanging. So it was really, really hard to process the whole thing,</p>
      
        <p>you know? And I think a lot of times we use comedy to kind of talk very painful things.</p>
      
        <p>And I was not in a good place. Plus, 2019, I also turned 50. So I think a lot of weird</p>
      
        <p>shit was happening. Thank God COVID hit, because I think... I was able to stay in one place</p>
      
        <p>for four months, kind of process it.</p>
      
        <p>So I think last year, I was able to stay in one place for four months, kind of process</p>
      
        <p>it. So I think last four years since COVID, I changed my act a little bit. Like, I did</p>
      
        <p>French Fest last year. You know what most difficult part for me as a comic? I think</p>
      
        <p>it's true. We want to do... Look, in Japan, if you tell a funny joke and people don't</p>
      
        <p>laugh, we have to kill ourselves. So... So when I tell stories, you want to tell funny</p>
      
        <p>stories and people get laughed, it's so difficult to tell a story as a comedian not to get laughed.</p>
      
        <p>And that's the hard part. And sometimes when you tell these kind of personal stories, I</p>
      
        <p>think people will keep hearing as long as it comes from a good place and people trust</p>
      
        <p>you. But believe me, it's not easy. This is more difficult than... Like, for Japanese,</p>
      
        <p>Bukkake film is more comfortable than saying, I love you and thank you. And I think that's</p>
      
        <p>the hard part. I think it's the hard part. I think it's the hard part. I think it's the hard part.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's the hard part. And when people say that, I think it's the hard part.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean? You know what I mean? You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Emotion.</p>
      
        <p>Emotion. It's so difficult. And it's easy for Worshiner. But I think when I say things</p>
      
        <p>like, something happened to me when I was a kid, it's still lingering after 50 years.</p>
      
        <p>It's a little bit uncomfortable. And you know, we're both from Japan. The reason why we don't</p>
      
        <p>want to do, it's not because we're dishonest, we feel like we're making our problem yours.</p>
      
        <p>And it's really...</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
