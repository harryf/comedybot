        <p>She's going to sue you.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>No, I won't sue you.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know,</p>
      
        <p>and, um...</p>
      
        <p>So there's times I'm able to be</p>
      
        <p>very generous sometimes,</p>
      
        <p>right? At work in the store, because</p>
      
        <p>I want to make money, of course,</p>
      
        <p>but you want to help people, too.</p>
      
        <p>And, uh, I went into porn...</p>
      
        <p>I went into porn trying to make money,</p>
      
        <p>but I found out that, um...</p>
      
        <p>If you think I'm awful now, I was far worse</p>
      
        <p>when I was younger. So porn kind of</p>
      
        <p>helped me treat people better,</p>
      
        <p>because I think it gave me an opportunity</p>
      
        <p>to be generous sometimes.</p>
      
        <p>Because one time a guy</p>
      
        <p>walked in, really good looking.</p>
      
        <p>He looked like Daniel Craig, the guy who used to play James Bond.</p>
      
        <p>Good looking guy,</p>
      
        <p>Ralph Lauren jacket, uh, uh,</p>
      
        <p>I mean, just really, like, well dressed,</p>
      
        <p>good looking.</p>
      
        <p>Walked in, I said, hello, it's one in the morning.</p>
      
        <p>He didn't say anything.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, you know, maybe he's shy,</p>
      
        <p>so I just let him go. He's walking around,</p>
      
        <p>and eventually he walked up to me,</p>
      
        <p>sir, um, could you help me with a movie?</p>
      
        <p>Of course, that's my job.</p>
      
        <p>So I asked, like, do you have the porn star's name?</p>
      
        <p>Do you have company name, fetish,</p>
      
        <p>uh, the director's name?</p>
      
        <p>On and on, every question's no.</p>
      
        <p>So I said, sir, you know, we have</p>
      
        <p>about almost 11,000 titles.</p>
      
        <p>Assuming even if you have the movie,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if I can help you</p>
      
        <p>find a movie, because, you know,</p>
      
        <p>every thing I ask is no.</p>
      
        <p>And he said, well, if you look down,</p>
      
        <p>kind of sad.</p>
      
        <p>Well, I really, really need you to help me.</p>
      
        <p>Um,</p>
      
        <p>and kind of pause, like, you could hear</p>
      
        <p>in the back of your throat, like, you gotta help me</p>
      
        <p>find my daughter.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I was like, well, my response was,</p>
      
        <p>I was laughing inside.</p>
      
        <p>I'll be honest, I was being jerked off.</p>
      
        <p>So I thought maybe his daughter's</p>
      
        <p>doing porn, he needs evidence</p>
      
        <p>to confront his daughter. That's what I thought, right?</p>
      
        <p>Or,</p>
      
        <p>he could be Mormon, he just went jack off</p>
      
        <p>to it. So anyway, um,</p>
      
        <p>they're very special people.</p>
      
        <p>Alright.</p>
      
        <p>Wait,</p>
      
        <p>which canton in Switzerland have incest a lot?</p>
      
        <p>Which one is it?</p>
      
        <p>They always have an answer!</p>
      
        <p>They always have an answer</p>
      
        <p>to that one. Yeah, fucking</p>
      
        <p>cousin fuckers. Alright, anyway.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, so this is a scenario,</p>
      
        <p>right? Um, I'm trying to</p>
      
        <p>get more information. So this is what happened.</p>
      
        <p>His daughter got killed</p>
      
        <p>in a car accident like six, seven months before.</p>
      
        <p>And a year before,</p>
      
        <p>uh, I don't know if</p>
      
        <p>it's in Switzerland, but in America sometimes</p>
      
        <p>you have college girls' night out.</p>
      
        <p>They go strip club, like fun, you know,</p>
      
        <p>they see men dance or whatever. So they</p>
      
        <p>went, they just happened to be filming</p>
      
        <p>a porno movie. So they were like extra.</p>
      
        <p>So these girls are in the audience,</p>
      
        <p>cheering, having fun, they were filming</p>
      
        <p>for like one of the porn movies. So they were kinda extra.</p>
      
        <p>So literally,</p>
      
        <p>this is his daughter's</p>
      
        <p>last live footage.</p>
      
        <p>So he's visiting from Canada, you know,</p>
      
        <p>and, um,</p>
      
        <p>wanna find it. I mean, you know, I'm a pervert,</p>
      
        <p>but I'm not a monster.</p>
      
        <p>I'm gonna help this guy. I don't have a kid, but</p>
      
        <p>like, I can't even imagine. So,</p>
      
        <p>I'm using my</p>
      
        <p>what little</p>
      
        <p>porn power I have.</p>
      
        <p>I'm making an educated, kids-getty movie. Maybe</p>
      
        <p>she's alright. But, you know, I'm fast</p>
      
        <p>forward, look in the box, and fast forward,</p>
      
        <p>it goes from 1 to 2,</p>
      
        <p>3, 4 AM. I'm getting desperate</p>
      
        <p>because I really wanna help this guy, right?</p>
      
        <p>But he's going to see town, going back to</p>
      
        <p>Canada. So I'm desperate, and every time</p>
      
        <p>customers come in, you know, they're buying</p>
      
        <p>a butt plug or something, you know, get the cash.</p>
      
        <p>They leave.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>So I got desperate around 6,</p>
      
        <p>because, you know, pretty soon you need to go to the airport.</p>
      
        <p>So I call one of the customers, Glenn.</p>
      
        <p>You know, he's</p>
      
        <p>the number one customer at</p>
      
        <p>the airport.</p>
      
        <p>He's been buying shit since like</p>
      
        <p>1973 or something like that.</p>
      
        <p>So like, he really</p>
      
        <p>is</p>
      
        <p>Yoda of perversity, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know, he</p>
      
        <p>even look like Yoda. Anyway,</p>
      
        <p>so when I called Glenn,</p>
      
        <p>he was upset because he told his wife</p>
      
        <p>he stopped watching porn, which is a complete</p>
      
        <p>fucking lie. He's a fucking addict.</p>
      
        <p>But after I told him,</p>
      
        <p>you know, here's the circumstance,</p>
      
        <p>this guy's looking for his daughter. Like, you know, he's got kids</p>
      
        <p>too. He wanna help. So he said,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, did you check A, B, C, D, E</p>
      
        <p>different fetish section? Of course. Did you check</p>
      
        <p>this company? So he said,</p>
      
        <p>did you check the green and yellow</p>
      
        <p>section? So, when people</p>
      
        <p>used to rent movies,</p>
      
        <p>we put different</p>
      
        <p>stickers, right? Like, red means heterosexual,</p>
      
        <p>purple</p>
      
        <p>means bondage. So like, easy</p>
      
        <p>to put movies back in the box, right?</p>
      
        <p>Yellow,</p>
      
        <p>yellow, green, and</p>
      
        <p>blue,</p>
      
        <p>um, yellow means</p>
      
        <p>bisexual, green means transgender,</p>
      
        <p>blue means gay.</p>
      
        <p>So he told me, did you check that section? I said, Glenn,</p>
      
        <p>I told you, I'm looking for a girl.</p>
      
        <p>He said, Yoshi, you don't understand. Many</p>
      
        <p>of the male strippers are gay,</p>
      
        <p>they dance for the ladies, so you might</p>
      
        <p>see them in a movie where they're</p>
      
        <p>like, gay movies or whatever, but there's ladies cheering.</p>
      
        <p>And in fact, a lot of times when</p>
      
        <p>ladies see two gay men suck each other,</p>
      
        <p>they kinda cheer on.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know that, cause I don't watch that shit,</p>
      
        <p>right? So,</p>
      
        <p>I'm into the gay section, and I think</p>
      
        <p>we took like, I don't know, like 30 movies.</p>
      
        <p>Within 40 minutes, we fucking found</p>
      
        <p>her in one of the movies.</p>
      
        <p>And you know, um,</p>
      
        <p>he started crying.</p>
      
        <p>And,</p>
      
        <p>yeah, it's not fun to see</p>
      
        <p>anybody crying at a porn shop, cause that's not</p>
      
        <p>the behavior you see a lot. I mean,</p>
      
        <p>I'm used to seeing liquid come out of the body</p>
      
        <p>in a porn shop, but not</p>
      
        <p>from there, okay? So anyway,</p>
      
        <p>so I helped him. So like,</p>
      
        <p>it's situations like that</p>
      
        <p>it does make me feel,</p>
      
        <p>makes me feel better.</p>
      
        <p>That, you know, thank God, God made me</p>
      
        <p>pervert, right? So, um,</p>
      
        <p>I mean,</p>
      
        <p>it's one of those, one out of a thousand times</p>
      
        <p>I have to do good</p>
      
        <p>things, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So, um, so I</p>
      
        <p>think I, um, for me, working</p>
      
        <p>at Taibu Video Store, um,</p>
      
        <p>oh, you know,</p>
      
        <p>here's an interesting rule.</p>
      
        <p>Back in the late 90s,</p>
      
        <p>um, if you want,</p>
      
        <p>I'm sure German people like</p>
      
        <p>this part.</p>
      
        <p>Back in the 90s,</p>
      
        <p>there's only two cities you could buy</p>
      
        <p>VHS and DVD</p>
      
        <p>movies with shit in it.</p>
      
        <p>New York City and Portland,</p>
      
        <p>Oregon for some reason.</p>
      
        <p>So one time, they</p>
      
        <p>transferred me to Portland's</p>
      
        <p>Taibu Video Store, like, Old Road Pacific and</p>
      
        <p>Northwest, so I had to work at Taibu Video</p>
      
        <p>Store in Portland, right? So you know what happened?</p>
      
        <p>So, um, I was shocked</p>
      
        <p>cause we canceled shit porn.</p>
      
        <p>In, in, in, in Seattle.</p>
      
        <p>By the way, there's, there's a two</p>
      
        <p>kind of shit porn, I, I,</p>
      
        <p>I'm glad I could educate you on this.</p>
      
        <p>So there's</p>
      
        <p>Japanese and German ones, right?</p>
      
        <p>Now, Japanese people like,</p>
      
        <p>Japanese people like,</p>
      
        <p>uh, uh, um, smooth</p>
      
        <p>shit.</p>
      
        <p>So that, have you</p>
      
        <p>had a smooth shit come out of your ass? It's just like,</p>
      
        <p>it just, it goes straight into the water.</p>
      
        <p>It looked like a German</p>
      
        <p>boat, you know what I'm talking about?</p>
      
        <p>So, Japanese like shit</p>
      
        <p>that kinda bounce off their chest, right?</p>
      
        <p>But German's like the thick, chunky</p>
      
        <p>monkey shit, right? Like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, it's got kinda girth to their shit.</p>
      
        <p>You know, sometimes they have</p>
      
        <p>penises. Anyway,</p>
      
        <p>German would kinda stick on you, right?</p>
      
        <p>They'd be like, so anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So we, we have like Japanese</p>
      
        <p>and German shit, right? American shit</p>
      
        <p>porn, they're not that good. Germans,</p>
      
        <p>Germans,</p>
      
        <p>and Japanese, you know, they're like the,</p>
      
        <p>uh, Lexus and Mercedes</p>
      
        <p>of shit porn, right? And Americans</p>
      
        <p>like, eh, you know. So anyway,</p>
      
        <p>one time this</p>
      
        <p>motherfucker</p>
      
        <p>walked up to the shit porn area,</p>
