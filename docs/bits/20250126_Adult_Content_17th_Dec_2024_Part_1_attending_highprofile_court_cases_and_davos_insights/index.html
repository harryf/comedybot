        <p>So.</p>
      
        <p>So tomorrow I'm going to France.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to Nice.</p>
      
        <p>And I made a mistake.</p>
      
        <p>I should have gone to Marseille.</p>
      
        <p>And the reason I'm going to France tomorrow is because...</p>
      
        <p>Have you guys heard about this Mazon rape case?</p>
      
        <p>Her name is Gisele Petticoat.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, her...</p>
      
        <p>Her husband, the last 10 years, 10, 11 years, is now his wife, Al.</p>
      
        <p>A whole bunch of men have sex with her.</p>
      
        <p>Filmed this thing.</p>
      
        <p>And then, I'm going there as a technical advisor.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I'm...</p>
      
        <p>I'm kidding.</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going there, it's because...</p>
      
        <p>You know, one time I was talking to my boss, John Stelliano.</p>
      
        <p>John, why is it in Amsterdam, in the red-light district, how come there's a porn shop?</p>
      
        <p>I mean, people have sex with...</p>
      
        <p>prostitutes.</p>
      
        <p>Why would you get a porno? It doesn't make any sense.</p>
      
        <p>And John said something really interesting. He said,</p>
      
        <p>because, Yoshi, you could buy a piece of fantasy and you could take it with you.</p>
      
        <p>You could have sex with her, that's it.</p>
      
        <p>But when you have this physical copy of porn,</p>
      
        <p>you could keep running the fantasy over and over in your head.</p>
      
        <p>And I gotta admit, even after I got fired from Evo Angel 12 years ago,</p>
      
        <p>that had a huge impact.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm one of those weird people.</p>
      
        <p>I was one of the four people in the room when Ghislaine Maxwell found guilty verdict.</p>
      
        <p>She was an associate with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      
        <p>I went to the Trumps case, Danny Masterson, Harvey Weinstein, SBF, Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
      
        <p>So I've been going to a lot of the cases like this.</p>
      
        <p>I even went to Davos last year.</p>
      
        <p>And you know how Davos every year, I'm sure you guys follow, I'm sure some of you were planning,</p>
      
        <p>you know, they have all of those, you know,</p>
      
        <p>all of those stupid retarded ideas every year.</p>
      
        <p>Like sustainability was like two years ago.</p>
      
        <p>And then I guess this year was AI or whatnot.</p>
      
        <p>Do you really want to know this?</p>
      
        <p>Are you familiar with the World Economic Forum in Davos, I'm sure?</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>So if you don't know, basically some of the most wealthiest, most powerful, connected people meet in Davos, Switzerland,</p>
      
        <p>four days every January, talk about how to solve the world's problem.</p>
      
        <p>Never mind these people that want to cause the problem to begin with.</p>
      
        <p>Don't listen to them.</p>
      
        <p>This is my solution to you.</p>
      
        <p>You really want to know how these people think?</p>
      
        <p>Because this is what I did when I was there last year.</p>
      
        <p>I talked to all the sex workers who were servicing them that we, you learn everything you need to know about these people,</p>
      
        <p>the way they fuck people and how they abuse these girls.</p>
      
        <p>Let me tell you.</p>
      
        <p>So, so, sorry.</p>
      
        <p>I hope something is like a TED talk.</p>
      
        <p>It's not funny anymore.</p>
      
        <p>But I've been going through these things because I'm...</p>
