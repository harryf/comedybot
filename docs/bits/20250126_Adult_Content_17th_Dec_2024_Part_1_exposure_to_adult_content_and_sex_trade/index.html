        <p>But I remember one time my parents were fighting</p>
      
        <p>middle of the night.</p>
      
        <p>They always do this.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm scared because I'm just a kid.</p>
      
        <p>You just hear a scream and walking out of the bed.</p>
      
        <p>And my brother runs around.</p>
      
        <p>I run up and try to help make them stop fighting.</p>
      
        <p>I just don't know how to deal with conflicts.</p>
      
        <p>I just, I'm just a coward.</p>
      
        <p>I go downstairs into the library.</p>
      
        <p>And I think it's like a defense mechanism.</p>
      
        <p>I always pile these gigantic books in pile</p>
      
        <p>on top of each other, like trying to make a giant castle.</p>
      
        <p>So I go in and hide in there, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Well, this one time I need a couple more books</p>
      
        <p>to cover the top.</p>
      
        <p>And I ran out of the books and I noticed the first time,</p>
      
        <p>I had an upper corner shelf.</p>
      
        <p>There's like three books that I never noticed before.</p>
      
        <p>And so I put a chair, got them books.</p>
      
        <p>And these are like a specialized artsy nude photograph.</p>
      
        <p>I think they were European, French or something, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And they're all European people.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>White people.</p>
      
        <p>And can I give you a disclaimer?</p>
      
        <p>I was so ignorant.</p>
      
        <p>I just thought black, white, Latino, Asian people,</p>
      
        <p>these are like imaginary people.</p>
      
        <p>They didn't really exist.</p>
      
        <p>Because growing up in Japan, all you see is Asian people.</p>
      
        <p>So I thought these are like, I mean,</p>
      
        <p>white people are real as much as Godzilla was real to me.</p>
      
        <p>So I didn't know what they were doing.</p>
      
        <p>So they were nude or whatever, which I didn't care.</p>
      
        <p>But while they were having sex,</p>
      
        <p>they were doing something that was like weird</p>
      
        <p>or unusual to me.</p>
      
        <p>They were doing something I have never seen before.</p>
      
        <p>They were hugging and kissing each other.</p>
      
        <p>Something that I never saw my parents do.</p>
      
        <p>So I was looking at this as a young kid.</p>
      
        <p>I thought, I don't know what this is, but it looks wonderful.</p>
      
        <p>I wish my parents would do this.</p>
      
        <p>And so that had an impact on my life.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, here's another thing.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if you guys, some of you are old enough.</p>
      
        <p>They used to put stars in genitalia and nipples.</p>
      
        <p>Do any of you remember that in porno magazines?</p>
      
        <p>OK, some of you.</p>
      
        <p>Just how dumb I am.</p>
      
        <p>I thought.</p>
      
        <p>I thought white people had a star permanently.</p>
      
        <p>See, I didn't understand that they were covering that part.</p>
      
        <p>Because you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>We don't even think like that.</p>
      
        <p>You see everybody naked in a public bath.</p>
      
        <p>So I thought, well, these people must be aliens.</p>
      
        <p>Why would you have stars here?</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, I was a very confused kid.</p>
      
        <p>So that's why I had, I didn't think it was a bad thing.</p>
      
        <p>My parents got divorced.</p>
      
        <p>My mother took myself and my younger brother with her sister in Washington State, USA.</p>
      
        <p>I have a Japanese name, but I'm ethnically Korean.</p>
      
        <p>So my mom's sisters only spoke English and Korean.</p>
      
        <p>And I only spoke Japanese at the time.</p>
      
        <p>So I didn't know how to communicate.</p>
      
        <p>I was kind of relearning.</p>
      
        <p>And I was old enough to work in their grocery store.</p>
      
        <p>So imagine like, you know, imagine one day your mom kidnapped you.</p>
      
        <p>Until you, you know, you're like, you're a little girl.</p>
      
        <p>Your dad and I are divorced.</p>
      
        <p>All of a sudden you're living with your sister, your mother's sister.</p>
      
        <p>You don't even speak the damn language.</p>
      
        <p>And within a week, my aunt makes me work at the grocery store.</p>
      
        <p>Because even though I don't speak the language, I could do the cashier, put the items in grocery bags, you know, brown bags, whatnot.</p>
      
        <p>This is one of the first things I learned.</p>
      
        <p>My aunt and uncle used to sell porno magazines at the grocery store.</p>
      
        <p>So one of the first words I learned English language, jugs.</p>
      
        <p>Playboy, hustler, high society.</p>
      
        <p>Because the customer, you know, just like, like Andy, in some cases, hey, give me a high society.</p>
      
        <p>I know exactly what, I don't even have to look, you know, like here.</p>
      
        <p>If a lady comes in playgirl, right here.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, so I'm 10 years old in America, illegal, I'm selling pornography, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, and when I was in junior high school, I used to like smuggle porn magazine back then.</p>
      
        <p>Because, you know, for a lot of you, you know, you're a little bit older than me.</p>
      
        <p>You're growing up, porn is so easy to get.</p>
      
        <p>You know, just online.</p>
      
        <p>When I was a kid, I got like, Harry, we literally have to go into woods or middle of the street.</p>
      
        <p>When we say streaming porn, we had to go down the river and see porn magazines going down in the water.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>That's our streaming, right?</p>
      
        <p>And this is how dumb I am.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't understand when I found bots of porn, when the pages were stuck together.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know what that was.</p>
      
        <p>Can I also tell you something?</p>
      
        <p>I was collecting stamps at the time.</p>
      
        <p>So when I was collecting stamps, sometimes you see you stamp an envelope and how you</p>
      
        <p>unglue it, you get a, you know, little bucket with the water, loosen up.</p>
