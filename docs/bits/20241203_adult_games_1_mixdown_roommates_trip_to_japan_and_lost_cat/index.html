        <p>So, this was like</p>
      
        <p>five, six years ago when my roommate,</p>
      
        <p>Irish-American guy,</p>
      
        <p>it's been his lifetime dream to go to Japan.</p>
      
        <p>So he went, and the only thing</p>
      
        <p>I have to do is make sure</p>
      
        <p>to take care of our apartment, and</p>
      
        <p>nothing happened to his cat, Juanito.</p>
      
        <p>Well, here's the problem. As well, I'm not</p>
      
        <p>getting out of the apartment.</p>
      
        <p>It's a couple days away from American Holiday</p>
      
        <p>for the Fourth of July, so there's a lot,</p>
      
        <p>so there's a huge firework. The goddamn</p>
      
        <p>cat rented an apartment, almost a cat.</p>
      
        <p>So here's my dilemma.</p>
      
        <p>What do I do? Do I contact Rick</p>
      
        <p>and ruin his vacation?</p>
      
        <p>Or, take a chance, hopefully,</p>
      
        <p>I can find a cat within the next fourteen days.</p>
      
        <p>And I really couldn't make a decision, so</p>
      
        <p>this is what Rick's mom said,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son's</p>
      
        <p>cat, and you don't give him an opportunity</p>
      
        <p>to look for the cat, he's gonna resent you.</p>
      
        <p>So you tell him, and I thought about it, you know what?</p>
      
        <p>She's right. So,</p>
      
        <p>I emailed him, and because, you know,</p>
      
        <p>time difference between Japan and the U.S.,</p>
      
        <p>he finally called me fourteen hours later.</p>
      
        <p>And, um,</p>
      
        <p>the way he talked,</p>
      
        <p>you could just tell, have you ever talked to someone</p>
      
        <p>and been crying for a long time? You could just hear him</p>
      
        <p>make a big stroke. He goes,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat,</p>
      
        <p>but I gotta say something here, that, oh my god.</p>
      
        <p>He's gonna ask him to move out.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat?</p>
      
        <p>And, um,</p>
      
        <p>so, eat cat?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not, I'm not Chinese.</p>
      
        <p>Um,</p>
      
        <p>I was born and raised in Japan, you know.</p>
      
        <p>We don't need our lord and savior.</p>
      
        <p>Hello kitty. So anyway,</p>
      
        <p>um,</p>
      
        <p>that's our prayer. Anyway,</p>
      
        <p>so he basically</p>
      
        <p>said to me, please look for my cat, and,</p>
      
        <p>and, you know, every three hours, like a crazy</p>
      
        <p>person, like midnight, 3am, 6am,</p>
      
        <p>9, noon, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I'm walking down the neighborhood, like a crazy person, just</p>
      
        <p>shaking the cat food,</p>
      
        <p>, and I can't find</p>
      
        <p>the cat. So, one of my friends, hey,</p>
      
        <p>why don't you go on ADF, Funny Comic in LA,</p>
      
        <p>do his podcast.</p>
      
        <p>So I went on his podcast, you know,</p>
      
        <p>begging people, like, hey, you know,</p>
      
        <p>if you wanna volunteer, look for the cat,</p>
      
        <p>I live in Hollywood in Ichiban,</p>
      
        <p>please contact me. And better yet,</p>
      
        <p>if you found the cat, please contact me.</p>
      
        <p>This is where I made a mistake. I think it's not a mistake in</p>
      
        <p>Switzerland, because the people are nice here.</p>
      
        <p>I made a mistake by giving my cell phone</p>
      
        <p>number on podcast.</p>
      
        <p>So what happened was,</p>
      
        <p>I think that like, within four</p>
      
        <p>hours of the podcast</p>
      
        <p>is released, I'm finding, getting like,</p>
      
        <p>text messages.</p>
      
        <p>And they said, Yoshi,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, I think I found your cat.</p>
      
        <p>So I clicked the picture, and it's a</p>
      
        <p>picture of huge cock. And I'm,</p>
      
        <p>so next four or five, I'm getting cock pictures,</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I'm getting dick pictures, right?</p>
      
        <p>I know you probably get dick pictures all the time.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, are you here?</p>
      
        <p>I'm glad you're here.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, you know,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why I say you when I'm talking about dick pictures.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway,</p>
      
        <p>so, you know, I'm getting dick,</p>
      
        <p>and even a couple days later, when my</p>
      
        <p>roommate finally showed up,</p>
      
        <p>what happened was,</p>
      
        <p>when he drove me with his motorcycle, the goddamn</p>
      
        <p>cat heard him. So whole</p>
      
        <p>three weeks when I was looking for it, it just stared</p>
      
        <p>at me, but doesn't, you know, I'm looking at this</p>
      
        <p>fucking cat for three weeks. Anyway,</p>
