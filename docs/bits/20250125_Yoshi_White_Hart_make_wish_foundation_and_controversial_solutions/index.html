        <p>because you did something fucked up in previous life,</p>
      
        <p>you deserve no sympathy at all.</p>
      
        <p>So there's less than 1% of Japanese are Christian,</p>
      
        <p>and these are wonderful people.</p>
      
        <p>They really go out there and help people.</p>
      
        <p>But have you noticed people with good intentions,</p>
      
        <p>even though they have good intentions,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes their solution's not perfect?</p>
      
        <p>I could appreciate the intention, right?</p>
      
        <p>Did you know every Super Bowl in America,</p>
      
        <p>Make Wish Foundation,</p>
      
        <p>they will help kids with cancer.</p>
      
        <p>These are like 14, 15, 16-year-olds with cancer, stage 4.</p>
      
        <p>They probably have six months or less to live,</p>
      
        <p>and they get Super Bowl tickets there.</p>
      
        <p>And I think this is wonderful, but I say to myself,</p>
      
        <p>is that the best you could do for them?</p>
      
        <p>You know what 14, 15, 16-year-olds with cancer, stage cancer,</p>
      
        <p>with raging hormone, they only have six months to live,</p>
      
        <p>you know what they really need?</p>
      
        <p>What they really need is shippers, hookers, and porn stars.</p>
      
        <p>I know this is not a conventional thing to do.</p>
      
        <p>I know English people are very polite about it,</p>
      
        <p>but you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Super Bowl.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's wrong to let these young men die</p>
      
        <p>and never to have a big delicious titty sit in their face.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's wrong.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>Because, yes, don't let these guys die.</p>
      
        <p>Let them die like a man, right?</p>
      
        <p>Don't let them die like a man.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, is this your son?</p>
      
        <p>You know?</p>
      
        <p>Imagine he's 15 and he's dying from cancer.</p>
      
        <p>It's not his fault he has stage 4 cancer.</p>
      
        <p>You get him to premiere the game, this and that,</p>
      
        <p>but he said, Dad, you know what I really need?</p>
      
        <p>You know what I really need?</p>
      
        <p>I've got two months left.</p>
      
        <p>I would like to have juicy, delicious vagina, right?</p>
      
        <p>But he's under eight.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know, what's the consent age in England?</p>
      
        <p>16.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, let's say he's 13.</p>
      
        <p>He wouldn't have to have a vagina.</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, 99% of the time, you should fuck a kid,</p>
      
        <p>but this is one time you should fucking fuck a kid, right?</p>
      
        <p>I mean, I know it sounds awful.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I'm just saying, if he's dying from cancer for sure,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>You should at least give him a handjob or something.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>Wouldn't you agree with me if you're dying?</p>
