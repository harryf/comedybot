        <p>This this actually does answer the question.</p>
      
        <p>Do you guys remember what the question was?</p>
      
        <p>Can I do something?</p>
      
        <p>You know, one of my favorite things, you know, one of my favorite thing when I went to the porn shop, when I used to go to a porn convention, they used to go to the porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>And I was like, oh, I want to go to the porn convention in Vegas and have this porn girl sign autograph for customers.</p>
      
        <p>And you know how it is because you have the Internet.</p>
      
        <p>But back then, this was a huge thing.</p>
      
        <p>Like, Jin-Jin Lin would say, Johnny, eat my ass.</p>
      
        <p>You know, they sign it like that.</p>
      
        <p>Or Janet James would say, Tony, let me suck your cock, whatever.</p>
      
        <p>These are average guys.</p>
      
        <p>They're never going to have access to women that look like that.</p>
      
        <p>It makes them happy.</p>
      
        <p>So I was more than happy to go.</p>
      
        <p>I get autographed for them.</p>
      
        <p>But my most uncomfortable one was like I had friends or customers.</p>
      
        <p>They're dying from cancer.</p>
      
        <p>So I would bring sign items or audio clip.</p>
      
        <p>Hey, you better beat that cancer because I'm going to fuck you in Vegas.</p>
      
        <p>Things like that.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>This is the cruelest Make-A-Wish that I've ever heard.</p>
      
        <p>But Make-A-Wish is cruel because you know what's the first thing kids ask?</p>
      
        <p>Can you get rid of my cancer?</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, Johnny.</p>
      
        <p>We could give you a second option.</p>
      
        <p>But you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>So like, it's really not about sex.</p>
      
        <p>Because, lady, I hate to tell you, sex is overrated.</p>
      
        <p>We know that.</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>Wait, what?</p>
      
        <p>You said that with so much conviction.</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>By now I know.</p>
      
        <p>Sex is absolutely overrated.</p>
      
        <p>And, too, it's not about sex.</p>
      
        <p>It's about sex.</p>
      
        <p>And, too, please don't take this wrong, but beautiful women are like cockroaches.</p>
      
        <p>They're everywhere.</p>
      
        <p>The amount of time we think about sex and all the things, we're trying to get obsessed,</p>
      
        <p>it's so disheartening.</p>
      
        <p>You know how many Hall of Fame perverts I know?</p>
      
        <p>And I talk to these guys, like, they're fucking 80s and 90s.</p>
      
        <p>It really bugs me.</p>
      
        <p>Like, do you still have this urge?</p>
      
        <p>It's like, yeah, oh my god.</p>
      
        <p>It's one of the few things that make me want to kill myself because I'm just sick of those</p>
      
        <p>urges and stuff.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, I don't want to be 88 and kicking my dick hard and thinking about, you know what</p>
      
        <p>I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, I'm sick of it.</p>
      
        <p>You're going to Kyiv.</p>
      
        <p>You're not going to make it to 88.</p>
      
        <p>So it's...</p>
      
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
      
        <p>You know, another controversial thing that people get mad, but this is really, I'm serious</p>
      
        <p>when I say this.</p>
      
        <p>You know, when they have these 15, 16-year-old kids, they're like, oh, I'm going to be a</p>
      
        <p>sexist.</p>
      
        <p>And this is the first time I've seen 16-year-old kids.</p>
      
        <p>And they're dying from cancer.</p>
      
        <p>And they do want to do a nice thing for them.</p>
      
        <p>And I know they really mean well.</p>
      
        <p>But this...</p>
      
        <p>I'm not...</p>
      
        <p>I'm serious when I say this.</p>
      
        <p>I know they're trying to get them Super Bowl tickets to sign on.</p>
      
        <p>But you know a 15-year-old boy with cancer that only had six months to live, but they</p>
      
        <p>really need strippers, hookers, or porn stars.</p>
      
        <p>I know you feel uncomfortable, but...</p>
      
        <p>Well, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I hope...</p>
      
        <p>I hope your son doesn't have a cancer.</p>
      
        <p>I think he does.</p>
      
        <p>But if he has a cancer, he's got sex month, you better call me because...</p>
      
        <p>Letting that boy die without having big delicious titties hitting their faces, this is wrong.</p>
