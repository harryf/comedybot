        <p>We're doing a lot of stuff about babies.</p>
      
        <p>Do we have any parents here tonight?</p>
      
        <p>Parents, make some noise.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, do we...</p>
      
        <p>Does anyone here have parents?</p>
      
        <p>Parents.</p>
      
        <p>Make some noise.</p>
      
        <p>All right, good.</p>
      
        <p>We'll find some of them.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, all these people complaining about kids.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a dad myself.</p>
      
        <p>And it annoys me.</p>
      
        <p>That annoys me, people going on about kids.</p>
      
        <p>I've got this friend.</p>
      
        <p>Every time she talks about it, she's like,</p>
      
        <p>the way the world is today, I just don't know if I want to have children.</p>
      
        <p>And I don't understand that, guys, because as a dad, having children is shit.</p>
      
        <p>But the thing is, is if you think about that, human beings have been on this planet for more than 300,000 years.</p>
      
        <p>And sex only got good about 23 years ago.</p>
      
        <p>In fact, we only invented soap about 100 years ago.</p>
      
        <p>Or penicillin.</p>
      
        <p>Or penicillin.</p>
      
        <p>That's definitely the...</p>
      
        <p>Or, but another thing we invented was consent about five years ago.</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, it's always uncomfortable who laughs at that.</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>But, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, what I'm trying to tell you guys is that you think about it.</p>
      
        <p>Do you know how much traumatic stuff the human race had to go through for you guys all to be here just going like,</p>
      
        <p>I'd just rather drink a green tea frappuccino with oat milk.</p>
      
        <p>Just like, make some effort, guys, for all your ancestors, what they had to go through.</p>
      
        <p>Guys, having kids is easy.</p>
      
        <p>It's so easy now.</p>
      
        <p>It's so easy to just unzip your stomach and out pops the kid.</p>
      
        <p>And then you hand them an iPad, you're done.</p>
      
        <p>.</p>
      
        <p>See, you're already down.</p>
