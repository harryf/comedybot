        <p>there's a lot of lonely people out there,</p>
      
        <p>and it's really hard to make a human connection, you know?</p>
      
        <p>And I didn't know that's what I was,</p>
      
        <p>I went in for money, and I ended up with no money.</p>
      
        <p>. But.</p>
      
        <p>I think when I tell these stories quite often,</p>
      
        <p>after the show or they email me,</p>
      
        <p>things that bother them.</p>
      
        <p>It's nice to make people laugh,</p>
      
        <p>but sometimes it's nice to put a smile on people's face.</p>
      
        <p>Alright, thank you.</p>
      
        <p>Round of applause for this.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>Thanks for coming.</p>
      
        <p>I hope you enjoyed.</p>
      
        <p>Please come to the show.</p>
      
        <p>We have one question over here.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, okay, sorry.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Hello, hello, how are you doing?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, good.</p>
      
        <p>You being Japanese, right?</p>
      
        <p>Japanese people being known for their respectfulness,</p>
      
        <p>honor to the family.</p>
      
        <p>I wanted to ask, how did your family take it</p>
      
        <p>when they knew that you were working in the adult industry?</p>
      
        <p>John, please.</p>
      
        <p>So, it's a little convoluted,</p>
      
        <p>but the company I work for is called Evil Angel, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, anytime somebody asks my mom or my family,</p>
      
        <p>what does your son work for?</p>
      
        <p>My family say he works for EA,</p>
      
        <p>which is a video game company,</p>
      
        <p>electronic art.</p>
      
        <p>So, everybody think I work for that company</p>
      
        <p>because they see this computer programming.</p>
      
        <p>But to answer your question,</p>
      
        <p>I have Japanese name, but I'm ethnically Korean.</p>
      
        <p>So, I grew up in neighborhood was not looked down upon,</p>
      
        <p>and we were not part of the society.</p>
      
        <p>And the area I grew up is one of the worst area</p>
      
        <p>in Osaka, Japan.</p>
      
        <p>I work kind of borderline to red line district.</p>
      
        <p>And my mom's not a bad person,</p>
      
        <p>but when you're forced to marry somebody,</p>
      
        <p>you just can't, you just, you know,</p>
      
        <p>she had mixed feeling about having kids.</p>
      
        <p>The women who were kind to me when I was growing up,</p>
      
        <p>it was always women who were sex workers in the neighborhood.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know they were sex workers.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know what that was,</p>
      
        <p>but they just happened to be people</p>
      
        <p>who were rejected by society.</p>
      
        <p>And every time I got beat up at school</p>
      
        <p>because I'm ethnically Korean,</p>
      
        <p>I didn't act like Japanese person.</p>
      
        <p>It was always somebody who worked with sex work</p>
      
        <p>or the most kindness.</p>
      
        <p>And then I just want to say,</p>
      
        <p>if you want to live in a society,</p>
      
        <p>and maybe you understand what I'm saying is,</p>
      
        <p>if you want to live in a society</p>
      
        <p>where they treat women really well,</p>
      
        <p>if you treat even sex workers well,</p>
      
        <p>it will trickle up to everyone</p>
      
        <p>because that tell me that society,</p>
      
        <p>they protect all women versus in society</p>
      
        <p>like where I grew up in Seattle in mid 90s.</p>
      
        <p>Somebody broke into my girlfriend's room,</p>
      
        <p>apartment 95, tried to rape her.</p>
      
        <p>Thank God she made some was not going away.</p>
      
        <p>And I was upset every time I was driving near her house,</p>
      
        <p>even when she was sleeping,</p>
      
        <p>I'll just drive around and make sure</p>
      
        <p>nobody's trying to break her off.</p>
      
        <p>And when you drive middle of the night Seattle area,</p>
      
        <p>you meet a lot of sex workers, you know,</p>
      
        <p>and it's a very dangerous job because in 90s,</p>
      
        <p>there was a guy named Gary Ridgeway,</p>
      
        <p>AKA Green River Murders.</p>
      
        <p>He was killing all the sex workers, you know.</p>
      
        <p>He knows that nobody cares about sex workers get away.</p>
      
        <p>So my feeling is you want to live in a society</p>
      
        <p>that is good to women,</p>
      
        <p>they protect every single one of them,</p>
      
        <p>even if you don't approve sex work.</p>
      
        <p>If you protect the sex worker,</p>
      
        <p>that tells me that your country is doing something right.</p>
      
        <p>I think if you protect all women,</p>
      
        <p>this is the good news for everyone</p>
      
        <p>because they have kids, you know.</p>
      
        <p>They are your sister, mother, aunt, grandmothers, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, I hope if anything,</p>
      
        <p>next time I hope you become a little bit more generous</p>
      
        <p>with sex workers, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Please go watch Sean Baker's Anora.</p>
      
        <p>There's no director in America who is more protective</p>
      
        <p>and wonderful with sex workers, Sean Baker.</p>
      
        <p>Watch all his movies, watch Anora because he's wonderful.</p>
      
        <p>He protects sex workers.</p>
      
        <p>All right, do we have more questions at this point?</p>
      
        <p>Anyone? All right.</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to take you hostage.</p>
      
        <p>If you want to go home, you can go home too.</p>
      
        <p>You said you had an incident on a scene.</p>
      
        <p>Like on a job where you slipped.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Did you take a shower before or after you finished work?</p>
      
        <p>I took a shower afterwards, but I was one of the last ones</p>
      
        <p>because everybody was in line.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, I was like sticky like this.</p>
      
        <p>I have to wait for my turn for showering, you know.</p>
      
        <p>But, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Was it right up?</p>
      
        <p>And did they separate?</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, I don't know how you deal with that smell because.</p>
      
        <p>I can't even imagine what kum tastes like, but it smells so bad.</p>
      
        <p>It sounds like a really bad Chinese restaurant in Scandinavia or Switzerland.</p>
      
        <p>When white people tell me Chinese food is good, I don't trust you.</p>
      
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
      
        <p>But when I had like really bad Chinese food, kum smelled like really bad Chinese food.</p>
      
        <p>Really bad.</p>
      
        <p>Egg food, yum.</p>
      
        <p>Maybe these guys need to get checked out.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Thanks.</p>
      
        <p>But that was actually a joke.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>This is actually kind of funny.</p>
      
        <p>I was really nervous during the day.</p>
      
        <p>Like, oh my God, they're not going to like this, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Can I just say, we're going to have to funny on this one, Harry.</p>
      
        <p>Don't poison the well.</p>
      
        <p>No, I'm not going to poison the well.</p>
      
        <p>I think, I've known this guy for what?</p>
      
        <p>How long now?</p>
      
        <p>Six months.</p>
      
        <p>We've been talking a lot about.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, wait, wait.</p>
      
        <p>Before you continue, last thing I want to say.</p>
      
        <p>These guys really took a chance because I make people mad all the time on stage.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>They get really, really, really angry.</p>
      
        <p>And last time I was here, I did five shows.</p>
      
        <p>I could only say one was okay.</p>
      
        <p>Other four, they were really upset.</p>
      
        <p>And I don't want to do that.</p>
      
        <p>So they really took a chance bringing me over here because I don't enjoy upsetting people.</p>
      
        <p>But I always do, except when I did the special show where I talk about sex work and whatnot.</p>
      
        <p>So these guys take a lot of credit for bringing me over here.</p>
      
        <p>So, thank you.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>You don't have to make any money.</p>
      
        <p>You never make any money if you lose money.</p>
      
        <p>You go, Harry, and then we have one more question.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>By the way, if you're done for this evening, it's...</p>
      
        <p>If you need to go, you don't have to stay.</p>
      
        <p>We're over time.</p>
      
        <p>But the thing is, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I got to know Yoshi through Christian.</p>
      
        <p>And my thing in life has always been trying to understand what motivates people.</p>
      
        <p>And Yoshi is just a giant mystery to me of like how, why would this guy do these things through this life?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, I should tell you the one last thing.</p>
      
        <p>What is it?</p>
      
        <p>It's not...</p>
      
        <p>To me, the thing is...</p>
      
        <p>Thank you, man.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you, guys.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you for coming out, guys.</p>
      
        <p>Appreciate it.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>It's also like it's in the end a deeply human thing, all the things that people are motivated</p>
      
        <p>to do, but also that they hide through the things we do with our lives.</p>
      
        <p>I forgot to tell you.</p>
      
        <p>Also, it's extremely hard to have a conversation with Yoshi in general.</p>
      
        <p>He always just goes off on a random tangent.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And then you forget whatever he was saying.</p>
      
        <p>He's always saying that.</p>
      
        <p>It's taken me six months to figure out what the hell he was saying.</p>
      
        <p>2012, I got fired.</p>
      
        <p>2012...</p>
      
        <p>You did your best.</p>
      
        <p>I tried.</p>
      
        <p>2012, I got fired from my job from Evil Angel.</p>
      
        <p>You could listen to this podcast, though.</p>
      
        <p>Last day of August, where this porn star named Augustine, she killed herself up to public</p>
      
        <p>shaming.</p>
      
        <p>It was her husband got me fired from that work.</p>
      
        <p>So, they covered that in that podcast.</p>
      
        <p>And then last of August in 2019 was top 10 podcast, because it was not by a guy named</p>
      
        <p>John Ronson.</p>
      
        <p>Many of his books has turned into movies, like Psychopath Test.</p>
      
        <p>He's very famous.</p>
      
        <p>So, last 12 years and nine months, I've been traveling the world, going to places, anything</p>
      
        <p>with sex-related things.</p>
      
        <p>So, for those of you not familiar with Jeffrey Epstein, I went to his former partner, Kelly</p>
      
        <p>Maxwell.</p>
      
        <p>I was one of the four civilians in the room when she got guilty verdict, and I was also</p>
      
        <p>there for the sentencing.</p>
      
        <p>Elizabeth Holmes, Donald Trump, SBF, Danny Masterson, Harvey Weinstein for rape cases.</p>
      
        <p>So, next month, I'm going to France for the rape case.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, that's the one I want.</p>
      
        <p>Like, how is it possible this guy allowed a bunch of men rape her, like 15 men one night?</p>
      
        <p>Is it possible for you not to feel anything next day?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not being sarcastic.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I don't want to...</p>
      
        <p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what I'm trying to say.</p>
      
        <p>Like, how is it possible she could not tell that she was violated for 11 years?</p>
      
        <p>I don't understand female physiology at that level, and I've been traveling because I think</p>
      
        <p>some of the most richest people on the planet, because they have a sexual problem, what they</p>
      
        <p>do is they fuck...</p>
      
        <p>That's why I think when the rich people don't have a satisfying sex life, what they do is</p>
      
        <p>they fuck the poor.</p>
      
        <p>That's what I think.</p>
      
        <p>That's why I go to World Economic Forum, because when I went last year...</p>
      
        <p>And I'll listen to what these guys are saying in Davos.</p>
      
        <p>Talk to all the sex workers.</p>
      
        <p>That's what I did, because they could tell you, because these women are fucking these</p>
      
        <p>guys after hours.</p>
      
        <p>And there's a lot of really weird people, but they're fucking mean.</p>
      
        <p>Not surprisingly, you know?</p>
      
        <p>These same people are...</p>
      
        <p>These people claim that they want to help the poor, but these are the same people who</p>
      
        <p>put the people in poor position to begin with.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think because sex is a difficult thing to talk to, and because these people never</p>
      
        <p>got healthy therapy...</p>
      
        <p>They did all kinds of weird sexual stuff.</p>
      
        <p>Not necessarily rape, but, you know, fired 10,000 people from the company.</p>
      
        <p>They got...</p>
      
        <p>They get up on it.</p>
      
        <p>I'm telling you, you don't have to vaginally penetrate somebody to have a sexual gratification.</p>
      
        <p>These guys hurt people by sexual gratification.</p>
      
        <p>That's why I go...</p>
      
        <p>There's court cases in France or New York.</p>
      
        <p>May 5th is David's case.</p>
      
        <p>I'm gonna go for sure.</p>
      
        <p>I went to his house.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think...</p>
      
        <p>I think...</p>
      
        <p>I know.</p>
      
        <p>I go to every one of these really weird places because as a black man in the white world,</p>
      
        <p>he knows that when you're a pervert, white pervert will accept you.</p>
      
        <p>And this kind of deviant sexual thing going on all the time.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm trying to bring some light to it where...</p>
      
        <p>I don't mind people calling me pervert.</p>
      
        <p>I'd rather people talk about it.</p>
      
        <p>The more people talk about it, they'll start pointing patterns to deal with this problem.</p>
      
        <p>Because...</p>
      
        <p>I'm sure you probably agree to some level.</p>
      
        <p>I think some of the terrible things that happen in the world is because of the unhealthy sexual fantasies.</p>
      
        <p>Cool.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>We have time for one more question and then we have to wrap this up.</p>
      
        <p>Or if you guys are short in your questions, we can do two.</p>
      
        <p>You're really quick?</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>You start.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not an expert.</p>
      
        <p>How was your relationship with your father?</p>
      
        <p>My dad died in 2003.</p>
      
        <p>And we don't know if it was a suicide or my stepmother killed her.</p>
      
        <p>So, I talked about it in Joe Rogan's podcast.</p>
      
        <p>To this day, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>But you know what's weird?</p>
      
        <p>When you don't have an intimate life or growing up in like a European, like, hugging and kissing and having a loving relationship,</p>
      
        <p>I didn't grow up in that environment.</p>
      
        <p>And I noticed...</p>
      
        <p>If you don't have that kind of healthy intimacy, you look for something else.</p>
      
        <p>And Truman Capote, who wrote a famous quote,</p>
      
        <p>called,</p>
      
        <p>where family in Kansas City was murdered.</p>
      
        <p>He said something really interesting about...</p>
      
        <p>When you don't have intimacy, healthy intimacy in life,</p>
      
        <p>some people look for other intimacy.</p>
      
        <p>And very few things are more intimate than murder.</p>
      
        <p>And I think that's why when you look at someone like serial killers,</p>
      
        <p>there's a lot of sexual assault, but there's a lot of murder.</p>
      
        <p>Once again, going back to sex workers,</p>
      
        <p>a lot of the serial killers use sex workers as a service,</p>
      
        <p>but they start killing them because</p>
      
        <p>once you practice your fantasy and you reach the point where it doesn't do anything,</p>
      
        <p>if you want to go next level, you have to do something harsh.</p>
      
        <p>And they commit murder and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>So, I know all the things I talk is goofy,</p>
      
        <p>but really at the end of it, what I'm trying to...</p>
      
        <p>Focus is the fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>It could be sexual fantasy,</p>
      
        <p>but there's...</p>
      
        <p>Like Bernie Madoff ripping off a bunch of other Jews,</p>
      
        <p>he got up on it.</p>
      
        <p>Chairman Mao murdered a bunch of people.</p>
      
        <p>And when I read the reading when he was talking about it,</p>
      
        <p>you read it and you're like,</p>
      
        <p>holy fuck, this guy is getting off sexually by murdering people.</p>
      
        <p>You know, so...</p>
      
        <p>Cool.</p>
      
        <p>All right, let's wrap this up.</p>
      
        <p>We have one more question.</p>
      
        <p>You can say that for 15 minutes.</p>
      
        <p>I know.</p>
      
        <p>How does your work in Florida,</p>
      
        <p>your work in the history,</p>
      
        <p>affect your own sexual life?</p>
      
        <p>Or you feel like...</p>
      
        <p>Are you more numb?</p>
      
        <p>You know, because you've seen everything.</p>
      
        <p>Do you feel anything?</p>
      
        <p>Or what's about your own sexuality?</p>
      
        <p>Or kinks?</p>
      
        <p>Or does it affect you?</p>
      
        <p>I'll answer that other question.</p>
      
        <p>My parents got divorced.</p>
      
        <p>It was hard for me to know my dad.</p>
      
        <p>But I miss my dad, of course.</p>
      
        <p>But porn really was a factor when he was alive.</p>
      
        <p>To answer your question,</p>
      
        <p>I don't particularly...</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of a bad habit,</p>
      
        <p>but I don't like looking at porn.</p>
      
        <p>Not because I'm an old guy.</p>
      
        <p>I used to get paid to look at them.</p>
      
        <p>It makes me mad when I watch something,</p>
      
        <p>I'm not getting paid.</p>
      
        <p>Does that make sense?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>If you're a boxer,</p>
      
        <p>you usually get paid punching somebody.</p>
      
        <p>I'm punching a guy in the bar,</p>
      
        <p>but I'm not getting paid.</p>
      
        <p>It's weird.</p>
      
        <p>But intimacy thing...</p>
      
        <p>Oh, so I don't really date much, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Because women are wonderful,</p>
      
        <p>but working in the porn business</p>
      
        <p>is kind of weird for a lot of ladies.</p>
      
        <p>But I was dating somebody.</p>
      
        <p>I met somebody after the show in January.</p>
      
        <p>And she got so mad at me in the middle of June.</p>
      
        <p>She said, I never want to see you.</p>
      
        <p>But I was completely honest,</p>
      
        <p>and I should have read between when the lady said...</p>
      
        <p>See, before I met her,</p>
      
        <p>I already bought my ticket to Europe,</p>
      
        <p>because I was going to meet with all my sex worker friends over here.</p>
      
        <p>I told her exactly what I'm going to do.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not going to sex with them.</p>
      
        <p>But I talked with them.</p>
      
        <p>Even though she said yes,</p>
      
        <p>I should have read between.</p>
      
        <p>She really didn't know,</p>
      
        <p>but I did it anyway.</p>
      
        <p>I'm so stupid, I just went anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So I even post pictures,</p>
      
        <p>because I wasn't doing anything like,</p>
      
        <p>here are the sex worker friends.</p>
      
        <p>I was thinking,</p>
      
        <p>no women want to see...</p>
      
        <p>their boyfriend.</p>
      
        <p>Hanging out with sex workers.</p>
      
        <p>But what I do is,</p>
      
        <p>I hang out with a lot of sex workers.</p>
      
        <p>So I particularly like talking to old men,</p>
      
        <p>because they have years working with men.</p>
      
        <p>They tell me like,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes I feel like,</p>
      
        <p>something weird happened,</p>
      
        <p>or this customer walking,</p>
      
        <p>how did you...</p>
      
        <p>So they'll share me with 30, 40, 50 years of wisdom,</p>
      
        <p>working in business.</p>
      
        <p>Because there's things I'm really not sure about.</p>
      
        <p>Because working in brothel is not one of them.</p>
      
        <p>But I'm so stupid,</p>
      
        <p>looking back like,</p>
      
        <p>yeah, I'm putting pictures of hookers,</p>
      
        <p>and mad at some pictures.</p>
      
        <p>But I thought she was okay,</p>
      
        <p>because when I'm living in Miami,</p>
      
        <p>there's a place called Miracle Village.</p>
      
        <p>And I was trying to produce a show there.</p>
      
        <p>And there's a bunch of people live there.</p>
      
        <p>It's like,</p>
      
        <p>it's exactly 50 miles from Jeffrey Epstein's home.</p>
      
        <p>Eastward, Inland Empire.</p>
      
        <p>And everyone that lives in Miracle Village</p>
      
        <p>is registered sex offenders.</p>
      
        <p>And I do show them.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like,</p>
      
        <p>I do comedy show for registered sex offenders,</p>
      
        <p>because I do one in San Luis Obispo.</p>
      
        <p>And the reason why I do it,</p>
      
        <p>because,</p>
      
        <p>look, what they did was wrong.</p>
      
        <p>And a lot of time,</p>
      
        <p>they got caught looking at the child nudity,</p>
      
        <p>or something like that.</p>
      
        <p>Which is bad.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not saying it's good.</p>
      
        <p>But instead of you making monster out of them,</p>
      
        <p>you want to know like,</p>
      
        <p>why are they attracted to them?</p>
      
        <p>You have to talk to them.</p>
      
        <p>Look, imagine like a cancer has a stigma,</p>
      
        <p>and you talk about it.</p>
      
        <p>Cancer is a problem.</p>
      
        <p>And if the stigma is preventing you from talking about it,</p>
      
        <p>or finding a solution for it,</p>
      
        <p>this is bad.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm trying to remove stigma by,</p>
      
        <p>you know,</p>
      
        <p>I do these shows.</p>
      
        <p>So I talk to registered sex offenders,</p>
      
        <p>East Coast and West Coast,</p>
      
        <p>because I want to know,</p>
      
        <p>why is it every time these billionaires</p>
      
        <p>get caught doing something bad,</p>
      
        <p>it always have something to do with assaulting kids?</p>
      
        <p>I'm still struggling with this.</p>
      
        <p>What is the connection for that?</p>
      
        <p>You know.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>but,</p>
      
        <p>I thought,</p>
      
        <p>when I told her,</p>
      
        <p>I'm talking to registered sex offenders,</p>
      
        <p>she was kind of okay.</p>
      
        <p>But,</p>
      
        <p>I made a mistake about doing that because,</p>
      
        <p>she really liked me, you know.</p>
      
        <p>But I think it was too much for her</p>
      
        <p>to see her boyfriend hanging out with hookers.</p>
      
        <p>Alright, I think this is the great statement to end on.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a dumb guy.</p>
      
        <p>I thought,</p>
      
        <p>no woman's going to be okay with it.</p>
      
        <p>I don't think, you know.</p>
      
        <p>That's a great closing statement.</p>
      
        <p>No woman wants to see her boyfriend.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>She's got a lot of manners.</p>
      
        <p>I think she's going to get her boyfriend hung out with hookers.</p>
      
        <p>Thanks for the conversation.</p>
      
        <p>I really appreciate it</p>
      
        <p>because I was really worried</p>
      
        <p>and thanks for staying on the whole show.</p>
      
        <p>And if you have a question,</p>
      
        <p>you can contact me any time</p>
      
        <p>or after we go to the bar.</p>
      
        <p>I mean,</p>
      
        <p>you know.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, sorry.</p>
      
        <p>You'll find him on Instagram.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much guys.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      
        <p>You guys,</p>
      
        <p>you're absolutely amazing.</p>

        <p>Give it up for yourself, please.</p>
      
        <p>Give it up for Ari.</p>
      
        <p>Give it up for Yoshi.</p>
      
        <p>This has been it.</p>
      
        <p>Whatever this was.</p>
      
        <p>You guys were part of everything.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
