        <p>So, about eight years ago...</p>
      
        <p>My roommate, Rick, Irish American guy, he went to Japan to spend his lifetime dream to go there.</p>
      
        <p>So, only thing I have to do is take care of his apartment.</p>
      
        <p>And most importantly, nothing happened to his cat, Juanito.</p>
      
        <p>So, as I'm taking two garbage bags out of the apartment, and it's two days before Fourth of July, American National Holiday,</p>
      
        <p>there's a huge explosion.</p>
      
        <p>And the cat panicked just ran out of the apartment.</p>
      
        <p>And I chased the cat for three blocks.</p>
      
        <p>And I lost the cat.</p>
      
        <p>Also, neighbors didn't like it.</p>
      
        <p>They don't want to see Asian person chasing a cat.</p>
      
        <p>You know, it's not a...</p>
      
        <p>Cats and dogs, beware.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, so I didn't know what to do.</p>
      
        <p>Disclaimer, five years before that, when Rick went to Australia, I wasn't living with him at the time.</p>
      
        <p>But five years ago, when he went to Australia, his other cat passed away.</p>
      
        <p>So, two trips, one died, one disappeared.</p>
      
        <p>So, I don't know what to do.</p>
      
        <p>You know, what should I do?</p>
      
        <p>Do I contact Rick and ruin his vacation?</p>
      
        <p>Or...</p>
      
        <p>Take a chance.</p>
      
        <p>Hopefully, I can find a cat within the next 14 days.</p>
      
        <p>Now, see, you're telling people brave.</p>
      
        <p>But I couldn't make a decision.</p>
      
        <p>So, I went to emergency list.</p>
      
        <p>And the first one is Rick's mother.</p>
      
        <p>So, I called her.</p>
      
        <p>And that's what she said.</p>
      
        <p>You know, Yoshi, if you ended up not finding my son's cat, and you don't give my son opportunity to look for the cat,</p>
      
        <p>he's going to be very angry with you.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think you should tell him.</p>
      
        <p>And I thought about it.</p>
      
        <p>I think she's right.</p>
      
        <p>So, I emailed him because of the time difference.</p>
      
        <p>He finally called me 14 hours later.</p>
      
        <p>When I talked to him,</p>
      
        <p>have you ever had a conversation with someone who's been crying for a long time?</p>
      
        <p>I could just hear in his voice that he's been crying a long time.</p>
      
        <p>And he said,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat, but I got to say something here.</p>
      
        <p>I thought, oh my God, he's going to ask me to move out.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat?</p>
      
        <p>So, eat cat?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not Chinese, you know, right?</p>
      
        <p>I'm from Japan.</p>
      
        <p>We don't eat our Lord.</p>
      
        <p>We don't eat our Lord and Savior.</p>
      
        <p>Hello kitty.</p>
      
        <p>So, we do it like this.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, he just said, please, just look for my cat.</p>
      
        <p>You know, just do your best your ability.</p>
      
        <p>So, from next day, midnight, 3 a.m., 6 a.m., 9 a.m., you know, every three hours,</p>
      
        <p>like a crazy person, I'll just walk around the neighborhood shaking cat's food and say, Juanito,</p>
      
        <p>for one day, three days, a week, 10 days, I can't find a cat.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm really getting nervous.</p>
      
        <p>So, I call my friend, Eddie F.</p>
      
        <p>At the time, he has a very popular podcast called Talking Shit.</p>
      
        <p>So, I went on pod and I beg people, like, hey, if you find a cat, please contact me.</p>
      
        <p>Or if you want to volunteer and help me look for the cat, please contact me.</p>
      
        <p>Here's where I made my mistake.</p>
      
        <p>I give my personal cell phone number on the podcast.</p>
      
        <p>So, between 25 to 50,000 people have my cell phone number in Los Angeles.</p>
      
        <p>All over the world.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think two hours after the pod was released, a guy text me and said, hey,</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, I think I found your cat.</p>
      
        <p>I clicked the picture.</p>
      
        <p>It's a picture of a huge cock.</p>
      
        <p>And so, there's something about me.</p>
      
        <p>People want to show me their dicks to me, right?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>Not pussy, no vagina, no breasts.</p>
      
        <p>People always want to show me their dicks from, you know, all my life.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, I told him, please stop sending me those pictures.</p>
      
        <p>But three days later, when Rich drove back,</p>
      
        <p>from an airport in motorcycle, Juanito just reappeared.</p>
      
        <p>See, he was around the whole time.</p>
      
        <p>Even though I've been calling Juanito this fucking piece of shit,</p>
      
        <p>just watch me and not do anything.</p>
      
        <p>So, when Rick showed up, I went back to the pod and said,</p>
      
        <p>thank you for helping me, but please no more dick pictures.</p>
