    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>you know, sometimes people rent a movie</p>
      
        <p>and they're supposed to return next day,</p>
      
        <p>and sometimes they forget.</p>
      
        <p>So we charge $3.00 LATHE every day.</p>
      
        <p>Well, John spent renting for a long time.</p>
      
        <p>He doesn't return for one month, two months.</p>
      
        <p>Eventually it hit three months,</p>
      
        <p>so like, it's almost $100, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So eventually I called and left a message.</p>
      
        <p>Couple days later, a lady walked in and said,</p>
      
        <p>hi, I'm here for John's account.</p>
      
        <p>First of all, we'll never tell somebody</p>
      
        <p>they have an account or not,</p>
      
        <p>especially if it looks like their girlfriend or wife.</p>
      
        <p>So I told her, like, I can't tell you</p>
      
        <p>whether he has an account or not.</p>
      
        <p>And she said, I know he has an account</p>
      
        <p>because she left a message, and, like, I'm not sure.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not sure if it's a message.</p>
      
        <p>And plus, that's my husband.</p>
      
        <p>He died a month ago.</p>
      
        <p>So that's why he didn't return the tape.</p>
      
        <p>So she said, please, I need to know</p>
      
        <p>what porn my husband was watching.</p>
      
        <p>I usually don't tell them that,</p>
      
        <p>but I'm very weak when a lady crying, like,</p>
      
        <p>you know, she started crying, like, you know,</p>
      
        <p>you know, like, when they're crying,</p>
      
        <p>that's a weapon that they use against you.</p>
      
        <p>I can't do anything.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>And I put the monitor, and I shouldn't have done it,</p>
      
        <p>because it created more problems,</p>
      
        <p>because she looked like 15, 20 years of rentals,</p>
      
        <p>and why was my husband watching pissing film?</p>
      
        <p>Why was my husband watching Granny Gang Bang?</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>He was watching Fossil Fuckers number 14, 15, 16, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I cannot, I can't answer that.</p>
      
        <p>But ladies, you know what I realized?</p>
      
        <p>It took me 22 years to figure this one.</p>
      
        <p>This is how dumb I am.</p>
      
        <p>I think, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't think she was upset because he was watching porn.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I think she was upset?</p>
      
        <p>There was a part of his life</p>
      
        <p>he was so afraid to share with her,</p>
      
        <p>and I think that's why she was upset.</p>
      
        <p>And two, here's another mistake I've made.</p>
      
        <p>You know what he used to tell me?</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, my wife is the best wife.</p>
      
        <p>She's such a wonderful mother, a great chef,</p>
      
        <p>great love of my life,</p>
      
        <p>and also she just got another promotion</p>
      
        <p>at the architectural firm, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know what's sad?</p>
      
        <p>He never said that to her.</p>
      
        <p>It's really sad because he only told that to this pervert.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So I think she was upset because</p>
      
        <p>she feel like there's part of her husband</p>
      
        <p>that she never really got to know.</p>
      
        <p>And I think, I also understand where he's coming from</p>
      
        <p>because I think he was afraid to show that side</p>
      
        <p>because sometimes some people get weirded out or,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>It's like you get scared.</p>
      
        <p>Oh my God, my husband's a fucking weirdo</p>
      
        <p>or something like that.</p>
      
        <p>So this is, I think, is a sad thing for both sides, you know?</p>
      
        <p>I try to be compassionate to people, you know,</p>
      
        <p>because I think so many people are lonely.</p>
      
        <p>Now, within a couple of years, I realized,</p>
      
        <p>even if you have the money,</p>
      
        <p>if you want to open a sex shop,</p>
      
        <p>you have to get zoning laws,</p>
      
        <p>and they're only limited among each city.</p>
      
        <p>It's almost very difficult.</p>
      
        <p>It's almost like a mob run the whole city</p>
      
        <p>with who have a sex shop.</p>
      
        <p>So once I realized that, like,</p>
      
        <p>I don't think I could open a sex shop,</p>
      
        <p>so I decided, like, maybe I'll move to New York from Seattle.</p>
      
        <p>So my aunt said, oh, why don't you work for my business?</p>
      
        <p>We're gonna sign a lease for a nail salon</p>
      
        <p>in lower Manhattan so you could be a bookkeeper.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, great, I could stop working porn.</p>
      
        <p>So my aunt signed a lease on September 9th, 2001.</p>
      
        <p>She called me September 10, 2001, so you got a job.</p>
      
        <p>September 11th, I don't have a fucking job.</p>
      
        <p>So what happened, I decided to move from Seattle to LA instead,</p>
      
        <p>and a year and a half later, I went to a porn convention</p>
      
        <p>at my favorite porn company, Evil Angel,</p>
      
        <p>where Rocco Cerveri is one of the director and performer.</p>
      
        <p>Nacho Vidal, John Stagliano, it's all Italian.</p>
      
        <p>Like, John Stagliano, Joey Severo, John Leslie,</p>
      
        <p>this is, like, you know, Italian.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, Rocco is super Italian.</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
      
        <p>Extra time.</p>
      
        <p>Very.</p>
      
        <p>You know, and, um, Evil Angel's, like, the new movie,</p>
      
        <p>it's like, the new movie. It's like, you know, the new movie,</p>
      
        <p>it's like, the new movie, it's like, the new movie,</p>
      
        <p>like the New York Yankees of porn,</p>
      
        <p>or Manchester United, or, uh, uh, you know,</p>
      
        <p>the football team in Milan.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>You have to know that.</p>
      
        <p>Yes, thank you.</p>
      
        <p>Um...</p>
      
        <p>So I got a job there, because I was the only one applying job</p>
      
        <p>out of the 50,000 people visiting the convention.</p>
      
        <p>I got the job.</p>
      
        <p>And when I worked for the porn company...</p>
      
        <p>So when I worked for PornShop,</p>
      
        <p>I was getting a foreign degree in perversity.</p>
      
        <p>Now I'm working in a production company.</p>
      
        <p>I'm getting my PhD.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm working in a production company.</p>
      
        <p>I'm getting my PhD.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm working in a production company.</p>
      
        <p>I'm getting my PhD.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm working in a production company.</p>
      
        <p>So I learned a lot of amazing things about porn</p>
      
        <p>that most regular people don't know.</p>
      
        <p>So I learned a lot of amazing things about porn</p>
      
        <p>that most regular people don't know.</p>
      
        <p>So, um, 2007, we were having crisis in porn,</p>
      
        <p>for three reasons.</p>
      
        <p>One, iPhone and PornHub, it's destroying porn business.</p>
      
        <p>People watching porn, but they're not paying for it.</p>
      
        <p>So about 40% of porn business went down the toilet.</p>
      
        <p>So we were in panic.</p>
      
        <p>And three, we were heading global recession.</p>
      
        <p>So those three things were killing our business.</p>
      
        <p>So my boss at the time said,</p>
      
        <p>we need to make a new product to bring the customer back.</p>
      
        <p>You know what my boss's idea was?</p>
      
        <p>Let's start making fisting movies, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know, right?</p>
      
        <p>Now, you can put almost anything online,</p>
      
        <p>minus, you know, animal tapes or shitting or underage kids.</p>
      
        <p>You can't put that.</p>
      
        <p>But fisting online is fine.</p>
      
        <p>But as soon as you put it on DVD or VHS,</p>
      
        <p>you're gonna get judged by local community standards.</p>
      
        <p>So police could come and shut your,</p>
      
        <p>your store down.</p>
      
        <p>So this is a law in 2007.</p>
      
        <p>Fisting is legal as long as you don't put a thumb in there.</p>
      
        <p>That's the law in America.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why.</p>
      
        <p>You could put four fingers on somebody's mouth,</p>
      
        <p>anus, vagina, that's fine.</p>
      
        <p>But as soon as you put a thumb in together, it's illegal.</p>
      
        <p>So I asked my boss,</p>
      
        <p>what happens if a person's missing a thumb, right?</p>
      
        <p>So the law said, as long as you don't put a thumb,</p>
      
        <p>it's legal, and since somebody missing a thumb,</p>
      
        <p>this particular person could put all the way in,</p>
      
        <p>and it's legal.</p>
      
        <p>In porn business, this is known as rule of thumb.</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>see, you're learning something.</p>
      
        <p>I feel sad that he missed that joke.</p>
      
        <p>So Robbo used to cause a lot of problem for me, you know?</p>
      
        <p>He's a wonderful guy.</p>
      
        <p>But he's crazy.</p>
      
        <p>He does anything that he wants.</p>
      
        <p>So there was a scene when this issue, you know, was, you know,</p>
      
        <p>there was a scene when this issue, you know, was, you know,</p>
      
        <p>this Eastern European girl was tied to a tree naked,</p>
      
        <p>and Robbo shows up.</p>
      
        <p>But you know what happened?</p>
      
        <p>Robbo's naked, right?</p>
      
        <p>He walks in with a donkey.</p>
      
        <p>So he tied the donkey to a tree.</p>
      
        <p>Then he walk up to the girl.</p>
      
        <p>Now, when a girl's tied up,</p>
      
        <p>you cannot have sex with her right away.</p>
      
        <p>You have to untie the hand,</p>
      
        <p>because if you don't, that's an implied rape.</p>
      
        <p>So Robbo did that.</p>
      
        <p>He took everything off, everything's fine.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, here's the problem.</p>
      
        <p>Maybe you guys know, but I don't.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>When donkeys see people having sex, they get excited.</p>
      
        <p>So donkey's penis got hard and big, right?</p>
      
        <p>So when Robbo's having sex with this girl,</p>
      
        <p>donkey's getting excited.</p>
      
        <p>You know what Robbo makes the cameraman do?</p>
      
        <p>He make the cameraman film the couple having sex,</p>
      
        <p>but every once in a while,</p>
      
        <p>he'll pan the camera to the donkey's dick.</p>
      
        <p>That's a problem for me,</p>
      
        <p>because I have to edit that shit out.</p>
      
        <p>It creates extra five hours of fucking job for me.</p>
      
        <p>I don't like that.</p>
      
        <p>But Robbo thinks it's funny.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, look at the, you know, like, you know, like, you know.</p>
      
        <p>You know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know.</p>
      
        <p>You know, Robbo, so he does kind of stuff.</p>
      
        <p>Another time, Robbo was fucking this girl,</p>
      
        <p>doggy style anal, and he put too much lube.</p>
      
        <p>So when he put his penis out,</p>
      
        <p>all the liquid flew out of the ass, right?</p>
      
        <p>Which is, which is fine.</p>
      
        <p>Here's the problem.</p>
      
        <p>So when I'm using, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>When I use the editing bay,</p>
      
        <p>the fast forward, the fast forward.</p>
      
        <p>So you see the liquid moving out of the ass, out,</p>
      
        <p>the liquid, the liquid, the liquid, the liquid, the liquid.</p>
      
        <p>Like that.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why I'm looking at it,</p>
      
        <p>because depends on the frame.</p>
      
        <p>Sometime it looks clear, another time it looks green.</p>
      
        <p>Another time it looks like brown and orange.</p>
      
        <p>Why is that a problem?</p>
      
        <p>Because if that's shit, we cannot have that.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm sitting there, I'm using my eyes, like,</p>
      
        <p>is that shit?</p>
      
        <p>Or, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I was 40 years old.</p>
      
        <p>I had to sit there on the camera.</p>
      
        <p>So I have to, my, I have to sit there, I have to sit there,</p>
      
        <p>I have to call my colleague.</p>
      
        <p>There's six of us, six men standing in front of the camera,</p>
      
        <p>like a referee.</p>
      
        <p>And like, so three people say shit, three say names.</p>
      
        <p>So we have, we have a deadlock.</p>
      
        <p>So I have to call, I have to call a lawyer from downtown.</p>
      
        <p>And like, you have to fucking drive all the way</p>
      
        <p>from downtown to Van Nuys and make a decision.</p>
      
        <p>And of course, like, oh, that's fine.</p>
      
        <p>See, these are the kinds of things we,</p>
      
        <p>we always have to deal.</p>
      
        <p>Now, sometimes when Rocco's filming,</p>
      
        <p>he's filming movies and stuff, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So one time he was filming a movie where</p>
      
        <p>one girl, 40 guys, okay?</p>
      
        <p>Gang bang, right?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, my job, my job is to make sure,</p>
      
        <p>by the way, a lot of my friends think that's exciting.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>It's not exciting.</p>
      
        <p>If you could just smell what that room smells like.</p>
      
        <p>You know, it's not good.</p>
      
        <p>You have one beautiful girl and like 40 manholes.</p>
      
        <p>It's not, it's not fun.</p>
      
        <p>So my job is make sure they're 18 years old, right?</p>
      
        <p>And after they're done, somebody have to clean that room.</p>
      
        <p>I have to clean.</p>
      
        <p>So she's standing there, everybody, you know,</p>
      
        <p>do their business.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, ladies, but.</p>
      
        <p>So I have to mop.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, I'm a dumb guy, right?</p>
      
        <p>I thought I should have a big boots.</p>
      
        <p>Like with the big boots, because I'll be higher.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm away from all the liquid, okay?</p>
      
        <p>So this is what happened.</p>
      
        <p>I'm trying to mop.</p>
      
        <p>And because this is such a high boots,</p>
      
        <p>I walk and I trip and I drop, I drop right here.</p>
      
        <p>Just pull up, come right?</p>
      
        <p>I'm just wet here, wet here.</p>
      
        <p>I'm wet hair, right?</p>
      
        <p>So everybody, she's, everybody's covering their face.</p>
      
        <p>Like they don't know what to do, but I'm a funny guy.</p>
      
        <p>So you know what I do?</p>
      
        <p>I do, I do the snow angel on the ground.</p>
      
        <p>I do like a calm angel like this, right?</p>
      
        <p>I do that.</p>
      
        <p>Of course, it's funny.</p>
      
        <p>I don't like it because I have combed all of my hair.</p>
      
        <p>My hair looks like this, but you know,</p>
      
        <p>you have to have fun.</p>
      
        <p>I post rock, everybody laugh, it's funny.</p>
      
        <p>So, so living in LA, you know, I think I meet a lot</p>
      
        <p>of interesting people over the years.</p>
      
        <p>And when I'm doing comedy shows, I meet someone</p>
      
        <p>like a show business people.</p>
      
        <p>And one year, my favorite was on the Tonight Show.</p>
      
        <p>And when I was talking to Tonight Show people,</p>
      
        <p>when they find out like, oh, you work in porn business,</p>
      
        <p>sometime Hollywood stars said they like porn.</p>
      
        <p>So could you come back with box of porn?</p>
      
        <p>So next eight years, every time stars say I like porn,</p>
      
        <p>I bring box of porn for them.</p>
      
        <p>And a couple of times I met some of the presidential</p>
      
        <p>candidate, so I saw Obama before he was president.</p>
      
        <p>I saw Trump before he was president.</p>
      
        <p>Interesting.</p>
      
        <p>Because I met so many of those presidential candidates</p>
      
        <p>at Tonight Show, I learned something interesting.</p>
      
        <p>Porn have a really interesting way to predict</p>
      
        <p>who's going to be president of the United States,</p>
      
        <p>based on the kind of porn that was popular.</p>
      
        <p>So 2000 and 2004 election, the most popular porn</p>
      
        <p>is what I call torture porn, where they used to put</p>
      
        <p>ladies sat down in the toilet like Rocco,</p>
      
        <p>and they flush the toilet like, you know, waterboarding.</p>
      
        <p>Or they put ladies in a dog cage like Guantanamo Bay.</p>
      
        <p>That's when I knew Bush was going to win in 2000 and 2004,</p>
      
        <p>because he used to torture women.</p>
      
        <p>He used to torture people.</p>
      
        <p>Most popular porn in 2008 and 2012, interracial porn.</p>
      
        <p>We knew Brock got this shit, right?</p>
      
        <p>So in 2016, most popular porn was incest porn,</p>
      
        <p>where they're fucking their stepdaughters and stepson.</p>
      
        <p>Trump used to say all the time, you know,</p>
      
        <p>if Ivanka wasn't my daughter, I would date her.</p>
      
        <p>So we knew Trump's going to win it.</p>
      
        <p>And most popular porn in year 2000, senior citizen</p>
      
        <p>and dementia porn.</p>
      
        <p>So we knew Biden.</p>
      
        <p>Biden got that shit, right?</p>
      
        <p>So they have a really good job predicting</p>
      
        <p>who's going to be the next president.</p>
      
        <p>So another time, we had a really interesting,</p>
      
        <p>when Mike Tyson was walking around at the porn convention,</p>
      
        <p>saying, hey, Mike, you should come to our booth,</p>
      
        <p>because we have the best porn star.</p>
      
        <p>And he came to Eva Angel booth.</p>
      
        <p>Now, and that's Vanity, star at 2004.</p>
      
        <p>That's correct spelling.</p>
      
        <p>For legal reasons, you have to change.</p>
      
        <p>Now.</p>
      
        <p>So Mike Tyson, he's a star.</p>
      
        <p>So Mike came straight to our booth.</p>
      
        <p>So he's looking at Vanity.</p>
      
        <p>She's got her arm around Mike.</p>
      
        <p>And they kiss.</p>
      
        <p>And Mike's just grabbing her ass and tits like that,</p>
      
        <p>and got her number, and they're kissing.</p>
      
        <p>And this is me, obviously.</p>
      
        <p>OK, you notice I'm smiling, but nobody's smiling,</p>
      
        <p>and they're kissing?</p>
      
        <p>The reason why I'm smiling, because Vanity's</p>
      
        <p>got a beautiful eight-inch cock.</p>
      
        <p>So Mike doesn't know that.</p>
      
        <p>That's why I did it.</p>
      
        <p>I thought it was funny.</p>
      
        <p>Here's another thing.</p>
      
        <p>You notice I'm touching my ears right here?</p>
      
        <p>I'm telling Bella Donna, she's a female porn star, to Mike,</p>
      
        <p>I'm telling her, bite his ear off.</p>
      
        <p>For those of you who follow boxing,</p>
      
        <p>he bit Evander Holyfield.</p>
      
        <p>So when he heard me say it the second time,</p>
      
        <p>Mike gave me this look.</p>
      
        <p>Oh my god, I fucking ran out of there.</p>
      
        <p>Ran out like the way my dad would.</p>
      
        <p>My dad ran out of the public bath.</p>
      
        <p>Because Mike Tyson is a man.</p>
      
        <p>I'm Yoshi, I'm not a man.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>So I ran out.</p>
      
        <p>Now, the reason I'm telling you, this</p>
      
        <p>would have been kind of a funny story,</p>
      
        <p>but I made a huge, huge mistake.</p>
      
        <p>I learned something about Los Angeles and fantasy business.</p>
      
        <p>There was a guy named Dave Hanschmidt.</p>
      
        <p>He was a very big figure in Underworld, in adult business.</p>
      
        <p>He is a sex tape broker.</p>
      
        <p>So he brokered Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian tape.</p>
      
        <p>So they make way more money than regular porn.</p>
      
        <p>So I made a mistake.</p>
      
        <p>I emailed him and said, check out this picture.</p>
      
        <p>So I had a picture of Vanity with Mike.</p>
      
        <p>And I sent another email where Vanity's fucking regular guy</p>
      
        <p>in the ass with her dick.</p>
      
        <p>And third email, I say, if you think that's amazing,</p>
      
        <p>I have sex tape of Mike and Vanity, which is a lie.</p>
      
        <p>I just lied because I thought it was funny.</p>
      
        <p>And like, goof, you know?</p>
      
        <p>It's not funny.</p>
      
        <p>It's funny because next couple of months,</p>
      
        <p>he didn't threaten me, but he had ways with words.</p>
      
        <p>He basically said, look, I'm going to get that tape,</p>
      
        <p>whether you like it or not.</p>
      
        <p>And I know where you work.</p>
      
        <p>I never told him where I work.</p>
      
        <p>He somehow figured out where I work.</p>
      
        <p>I think a month and a half later,</p>
      
        <p>he just fucking appeared in my production company.</p>
      
        <p>I ran out of the back window and hid in a garbage can.</p>
      
        <p>And I really didn't know because I heard stories like,</p>
      
        <p>he's like a bit of a thug.</p>
      
        <p>You know, he has people working for him.</p>
      
        <p>Because you've got to remember, if you make it huge in LA,</p>
      
        <p>money, fame, and power.</p>
      
        <p>So you forget there's people like that.</p>
      
        <p>I'm panicking for like six months.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't know what to do until my favorite movie star, Tom</p>
      
        <p>Cruise, got him killed.</p>
      
        <p>OK, not technically.</p>
      
        <p>But what happened was, Hans Schmidt said,</p>
      
        <p>he claims he had the wedding picture between Tom and Katie</p>
      
        <p>Holmes at the time.</p>
      
        <p>Then he said, I'm going to get that tape.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to get that tape.</p>
      
        <p>And he said, he has sex tape of Tom Cruise.</p>
      
        <p>Now, he implied it might be with another man.</p>
      
        <p>Well, Tom Cruise is not an idiot.</p>
      
        <p>He's not superstar for no reason.</p>
      
        <p>He went to FBI, completely honest with everything.</p>
      
        <p>Guy, this guy, arrested.</p>
      
        <p>Two weeks later, Hans Schmidt killed himself.</p>
      
        <p>So when this happened, I said to myself,</p>
      
        <p>thank god for Scientology.</p>
      
        <p>Fuck that.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to kill this guy.</p>
      
        <p>Jesus Christ.</p>
      
        <p>My life is saved.</p>
      
        <p>I was so scared.</p>
      
        <p>You know, fuck this guy, right?</p>
      
        <p>Unbelievable.</p>
      
        <p>I love Tom Cruise.</p>
      
        <p>I learned a hard lesson that you shouldn't fuck with people</p>
      
        <p>like that because money and fame is such a powerful thing.</p>
      
        <p>People almost do anything.</p>
      
        <p>Now, you know, somebody asked me one time, do you still have</p>
      
        <p>fantasy?</p>
      
        <p>Because I produced like 800 porn movies.</p>
      
        <p>That's a really good question.</p>
      
        <p>I only have one fantasy left.</p>
      
        <p>My fantasy is, did you know when the United States killed Bin Laden, we sent a Navy SEAL</p>
      
        <p>there.</p>
      
        <p>Not only did they kill Bin Laden, they took two of his laptop and a hard drive.</p>
      
        <p>It's full of porn.</p>
      
        <p>So I sent a letter to the US government, want to know what porn Bin Laden was watching.</p>
      
        <p>I really want to know.</p>
      
        <p>The reason I want to know is because my fantasy, I pray to god the porn that he was watching</p>
      
        <p>is a movie I made.</p>
      
        <p>My fantasy is that I'm going to kill him.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to kill him.</p>
      
        <p>My porno is so good when he's jacking off, you know, ha ha ha ha.</p>
      
        <p>Navy SEALs walking up the stairs and end up shooting him.</p>
      
        <p>That's my fantasy right there, right?</p>
      
        <p>Well, everything comes to an end.</p>
      
        <p>Nothing lasts forever.</p>
      
        <p>In 2012, I was fired from Evil Angel.</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to get in detail, but there's a very famous podcast called The Last Day</p>
      
        <p>of August in 2019.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>August Ames killed herself.</p>
      
        <p>I'm in that pod.</p>
      
        <p>And she killed herself because she told a bunch of people that, ladies, if you work</p>
      
        <p>with men doing gay porno, just be aware there's a higher rate of getting HIV if you do that.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not saying don't do it.</p>
      
        <p>Just be aware that it's more dangerous.</p>
      
        <p>So, I thought she was very fair.</p>
      
        <p>Just aware.</p>
      
        <p>Well, industry turned against her, shamed her for two weeks, then she killed herself.</p>
      
        <p>Very sad.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why they interviewed me, because August Ames' husband, he's a very famous</p>
      
        <p>person, his husband got me fired from the job.</p>
      
        <p>So, if you want to know, you could just listen to The Last Day of August 2019.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you for listening.</p>
      
        <p>So, I got fired.</p>
      
        <p>I got offered to work for other porn companies.</p>
      
        <p>But I didn't want to get another job at another porn company because, I'll be honest, there's</p>
      
        <p>parts of porn that's a little crazy, and two, I have to say, you know, when I go to Italy,</p>
      
        <p>Your country, like in many of Latin American countries,</p>
      
        <p>just pro-family.</p>
      
        <p>The family is the most important thing.</p>
      
        <p>Porn is not necessarily pro-family, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>So I thought, I got to the age where,</p>
      
        <p>maybe I should just move on.</p>
      
        <p>I don't hate porn, but maybe I'd be better off</p>
      
        <p>trying to be normal.</p>
      
        <p>So I got out of the job, and last 11 and a half years</p>
      
        <p>I've been traveling the world.</p>
      
        <p>I have not paid rent since February of 2012.</p>
      
        <p>I've been traveling.</p>
      
        <p>Using my pornographic knowledge and my pornographic vision,</p>
      
        <p>I've been traveling the world,</p>
      
        <p>trying to make the world a better place.</p>
      
        <p>It's what I call perverts without borders.</p>
      
        <p>Now when I say pornographic eyes,</p>
      
        <p>if you show me porn from 2012 or earlier,</p>
      
        <p>and you show me a penis,</p>
      
        <p>I could tell you about 95% accuracy</p>
      
        <p>whose penis that belongs to.</p>
      
        <p>You show me buttholes, like 85, 90% accuracy,</p>
      
        <p>both men, women, trans,</p>
      
        <p>you know, like that.</p>
      
        <p>I'll put that in your resume.</p>
      
        <p>Now, in one time I was watching a commercial in America.</p>
      
        <p>It's one of those athletic gym membership, right?</p>
      
        <p>So they were exercising, and I told my friend,</p>
      
        <p>did you see that?</p>
      
        <p>And nobody caught it.</p>
      
        <p>There's an exercise where the lady's flat in an exercise,</p>
      
        <p>lifting her leg.</p>
      
        <p>When she lifted her leg, I could see her pussy lip,</p>
      
        <p>because she wasn't wearing panties.</p>
      
        <p>But it's really small split second.</p>
      
        <p>So I have a pretty good eye for catching stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>So I've been traveling around the country,</p>
      
        <p>using my knowledge.</p>
      
        <p>For those of you who know MAGA,</p>
      
        <p>Make America Great Again,</p>
      
        <p>they're the Trump people, mostly white people.</p>
      
        <p>I went to that rallies.</p>
      
        <p>I went to Black Lives Matter rallies too.</p>
      
        <p>Now, interesting, when I go to MAGA Trump people,</p>
      
        <p>you know what's their favorite kind of porn?</p>
      
        <p>Big tits.</p>
      
        <p>Kind of makes sense because most of the Trump people are white.</p>
      
        <p>White people traditionally come from Northern Europe.</p>
      
        <p>Historically, what's the main diet of Northern Europe?</p>
      
        <p>Dairy.</p>
      
        <p>Where does dairy come from?</p>
      
        <p>Big tits.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm going to show you.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to show you.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to show you where dairy comes from.</p>
      
        <p>Big tits, like cows, right?</p>
      
        <p>If you see BLM, like black, Latinos, some Asian people,</p>
      
        <p>they come from Southern region, so they're ass men.</p>
      
        <p>So sometimes when I see these two people arguing,</p>
      
        <p>it's like tits, ass, tits, ass.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm saying, like Bronco would say,</p>
      
        <p>hey guys, you could like both.</p>
      
        <p>You should like tits and ass, right?</p>
      
        <p>But they're fighting.</p>
      
        <p>You know what's interesting?</p>
      
        <p>Do you know the group that won these poor whites and poor minorities fight each other?</p>
      
        <p>The super rich elite people.</p>
      
        <p>They want the poor people to fight each other.</p>
      
        <p>And you know what rich people are into?</p>
      
        <p>They're not into tits or asses.</p>
      
        <p>I went to Kensington, London.</p>
      
        <p>I went to Upper East Side, New York.</p>
      
        <p>Ginza in Tokyo.</p>
      
        <p>I went to the expensive places in Paris, Dubai.</p>
      
        <p>Every place I go, whether in Africa, Latin America,</p>
      
        <p>rich people always are attracted to women who are tall,</p>
      
        <p>no tits and no asses.</p>
      
        <p>So, when you see the church,</p>
      
        <p>Jeffrey Epstein's victims,</p>
      
        <p>they're kids.</p>
      
        <p>They have no tits and asses.</p>
      
        <p>Something about super rich and elite people,</p>
      
        <p>they like that kind of body type.</p>
      
        <p>One of my theories,</p>
      
        <p>I meet a lot of high tech guys, tech bros,</p>
      
        <p>the people who are on Silicon Valley.</p>
      
        <p>They're not men.</p>
      
        <p>They're boys.</p>
      
        <p>You know, their taste is like,</p>
      
        <p>they don't see women as a whole thing.</p>
      
        <p>They don't see women.</p>
      
        <p>They only see body parts.</p>
      
        <p>So, the reason why they like those skinny women,</p>
      
        <p>because the only thing they care about is three holes.</p>
      
        <p>Mouth, pussy and asshole.</p>
      
        <p>So, skinnier the person,</p>
      
        <p>you get closest to three things that they only care.</p>
      
        <p>They don't care about the rest of them.</p>
      
        <p>And people like that cause the most problems, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I was one of the four people who went to court</p>
      
        <p>with the Ghislaine Maxwell's case.</p>
      
        <p>So, I was there.</p>
      
        <p>I was one of the four civilians watching her get a guilty verdict.</p>
      
        <p>And I also went for sentencing.</p>
      
        <p>And interesting, during the sentencing,</p>
      
        <p>all the victims, these women,</p>
      
        <p>they each spoke for the victims,</p>
      
        <p>you know, what happened to them.</p>
      
        <p>And even though they're 35, 40, maybe 45 years old,</p>
      
        <p>when I look at them, I see them as kids, you know.</p>
      
        <p>It's a heartbreaker because I've been reading about them for so long.</p>
      
        <p>It's terrible what happened to them as kids.</p>
      
        <p>One after another, they talk about how they were abused.</p>
      
        <p>So, they're finished.</p>
      
        <p>Judge Nathan was ready to give a sentence.</p>
      
        <p>The defense said,</p>
      
        <p>excuse me, Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell would like to speak.</p>
      
        <p>Shocking.</p>
      
        <p>She never spoke one time during trial,</p>
      
        <p>but she wanted to speak at the sentencing.</p>
      
        <p>For those of you in English,</p>
      
        <p>I finally learned the word posh,</p>
      
        <p>upper class,</p>
      
        <p>the Cambridge, Oxford level English,</p>
      
        <p>the language of speaking to nobility,</p>
      
        <p>the Pope and President.</p>
      
        <p>Because when Ghislaine Maxwell spoke,</p>
      
        <p>I'm not going to lie, I was seduced by her.</p>
      
        <p>She sounds like female Darth Vader.</p>
      
        <p>The way she speaks to you,</p>
      
        <p>like authority, sexiness, power,</p>
      
        <p>all of a sudden, I forgot the victims right away.</p>
      
        <p>You know what's sad?</p>
      
        <p>Next day when I read the transcript,</p>
      
        <p>she didn't even apologize.</p>
      
        <p>She spoke with authority,</p>
      
        <p>but she put all the blame on Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I was 53 years old when I heard her speak,</p>
      
        <p>and I was seduced.</p>
      
        <p>Do you think 14, 15, 16 year old girls have a chance?</p>
      
        <p>They have no chance.</p>
      
        <p>These are kids with no father,</p>
      
        <p>no opportunity.</p>
      
        <p>They live in a really tough neighborhood.</p>
      
        <p>Imagine you have little to no opportunity.</p>
      
        <p>This beautiful English lady,</p>
      
        <p>who is a millionaire,</p>
      
        <p>knows all the most powerful people on the planet,</p>
      
        <p>trying to give you the whole world.</p>
      
        <p>I think that's why I like to travel the world,</p>
      
        <p>talk about this stuff,</p>
      
        <p>because did you know that most of the kids getting abused,</p>
      
        <p>if they know that their parents don't like talking about sex,</p>
      
        <p>they will not come and ask for help,</p>
      
        <p>because they don't want to upset their parents.</p>
      
        <p>So, if you're a parent,</p>
      
        <p>and you take that stance,</p>
      
        <p>what you're basically doing is,</p>
      
        <p>you're endangering your kids,</p>
      
        <p>because kids know that they can't come to you.</p>
      
        <p>It's very shameful.</p>
      
        <p>If you're a parent,</p>
      
        <p>you should be open to talk to your kids about anything.</p>
      
        <p>That's why every time I do comedy show and talk,</p>
      
        <p>I always do dirty jokes,</p>
      
        <p>and people always complain,</p>
      
        <p>why do you have to talk dirty?</p>
      
        <p>Well, how dare you?</p>
      
        <p>You're an adult,</p>
      
        <p>you can't take a dirty joke.</p>
      
        <p>It's people like you,</p>
      
        <p>are endangering kids every fucking day.</p>
      
        <p>So that's why I like talking about this subject matter.</p>
      
        <p>Since you're cool,</p>
      
        <p>let me do one last one,</p>
      
        <p>and I'll finish.</p>
      
        <p>By the way,</p>
      
        <p>this is a Ben Laden joke.</p>
      
        <p>I was fantasizing,</p>
      
        <p>he's Hillary and Obama.</p>
      
        <p>Remember when they killed Ben Laden?</p>
      
        <p>So I'm right here,</p>
      
        <p>I'm so happy.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, so I'll finish with this.</p>
      
        <p>I was always worried,</p>
      
        <p>working at a porn company,</p>
      
        <p>especially in porn shops,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes customers are going to ask,</p>
      
        <p>inappropriate product.</p>
      
        <p>Underage kids, obviously.</p>
      
        <p>But you know the one that I was really worried?</p>
      
        <p>I was worried that sometime,</p>
      
        <p>maybe somebody's going to ask for,</p>
      
        <p>rape porn.</p>
      
        <p>And it did happen.</p>
      
        <p>Do you know who asked for rape movies?</p>
      
        <p>Every single time?</p>
      
        <p>It's women.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I'm not saying,</p>
      
        <p>all women have rape fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>Some women do have rape fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>But if you have a rape fantasy,</p>
      
        <p>you can't go public and say,</p>
      
        <p>hey, I like rape,</p>
      
        <p>because you might get attacked.</p>
      
        <p>So how do some women,</p>
      
        <p>who are into rape fantasy,</p>
      
        <p>explore that fantasy?</p>
      
        <p>They do it by thinking,</p>
      
        <p>reading,</p>
      
        <p>and watching stories about vampires.</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>if you think about it,</p>
      
        <p>if you read vampire,</p>
      
        <p>watch vampire movie,</p>
      
        <p>what does this vampire do?</p>
      
        <p>They fly in the middle of the night,</p>
      
        <p>into women's bedroom.</p>
      
        <p>What is the word they use?</p>
      
        <p>They ravish her.</p>
      
        <p>So next you know it,</p>
      
        <p>they're biting her neck,</p>
      
        <p>seducing her.</p>
      
        <p>But if you take the words,</p>
      
        <p>vampire Dracula,</p>
      
        <p>that is the action of a rapist.</p>
      
        <p>You can't just go into women's bedroom</p>
      
        <p>and start raving their clothes.</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>men judge women usually by visual cues.</p>
      
        <p>But women tend to like psychological cues.</p>
      
        <p>So sometimes you see women with ugly guys,</p>
      
        <p>because there's a psychological part</p>
      
        <p>that's satisfying.</p>
      
        <p>Now,</p>
      
        <p>do you know what's the full body part</p>
      
        <p>the men Google online</p>
      
        <p>for sexual satisfaction?</p>
      
        <p>Take a guess.</p>
      
        <p>What's the full favorite body part?</p>
      
        <p>Feet.</p>
      
        <p>Feet?</p>
      
        <p>Yes, feet.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, feet.</p>
      
        <p>Fingers.</p>
      
        <p>Lips.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, feet, ass.</p>
      
        <p>Did you say tits?</p>
      
        <p>I said tits.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, yes.</p>
      
        <p>So feet, ass, and tits.</p>
      
        <p>One more.</p>
      
        <p>This is a tricky one.</p>
      
        <p>Fingers.</p>
      
        <p>No, it's penis.</p>
      
        <p>Why?</p>
      
        <p>Not because men are interested in penis.</p>
      
        <p>There are type movies like Little White Chains,</p>
      
        <p>The Little White Chains,</p>
      
        <p>and The Little White Chains.</p>
      
        <p>But they're not just about penis.</p>
      
        <p>They're about the penis.</p>
      
        <p>And the penis is like Little White Chick,</p>
      
        <p>Big Black Monster Dick.</p>
      
        <p>They're anticipating women's reactions in Huge Dick.</p>
      
        <p>That's why they're Googling.</p>
      
        <p>That's why transgender porn is popular</p>
      
        <p>because it has feet, ass, tits, and dick.</p>
      
        <p>It's called sexual optical illusion.</p>
      
        <p>Gay men are not into transgender stuff at all.</p>
      
        <p>It's heterosexual men.</p>
      
        <p>There's another porn star named Angel,</p>
      
        <p>Buck Angel.</p>
      
        <p>She looked like a muscular,</p>
      
        <p>skinhead looking guy.</p>
      
        <p>Big chest.</p>
      
        <p>Looked like that.</p>
      
        <p>But she has a vagina.</p>
      
        <p>And she's a woman.</p>
      
        <p>She's a woman.</p>
      
        <p>Big chest.</p>
      
        <p>Looked like that.</p>
      
        <p>But she has a vagina.</p>
      
        <p>Heterosexual men are not interested in her.</p>
      
        <p>Gay men are interested in her,</p>
      
        <p>even though she has a vagina.</p>
      
        <p>Because different psychological cues.</p>
      
        <p>So next time when you see something like this,</p>
      
        <p>it has an underlying theme.</p>
      
        <p>Like a woman getting manhandled.</p>
      
        <p>Or sea monster is another one that they like.</p>
      
        <p>Werewolf is very popular.</p>
      
        <p>You know, remember Beauty and the Beast?</p>
      
        <p>The women say,</p>
      
        <p>I could change him.</p>
      
        <p>Women like men in prison</p>
      
        <p>because they're a monster.</p>
      
        <p>They could go to jail.</p>
      
        <p>They could control.</p>
      
        <p>This is the part that makes me sad.</p>
      
        <p>This lady says she likes getting manhandled.</p>
      
        <p>She got fired from her job.</p>
      
        <p>Isn't it sad?</p>
      
        <p>When the women say she loves something,</p>
      
        <p>I think it's women's right to have orgasm.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's women's right to have what they want.</p>
      
        <p>It shouldn't be always about men's needs.</p>
      
        <p>I think it should be 50-50 both ways.</p>
      
        <p>Well, she said what she wanted.</p>
      
        <p>They fucking fired her.</p>
      
        <p>So it's terrible.</p>
      
        <p>I got to end the show.</p>
      
        <p>So I tell all the women,</p>
      
        <p>I tell all the stories</p>
      
        <p>because when I was talking to my friend Asa Kira,</p>
      
        <p>she's an Asian porn star.</p>
      
        <p>One time she did triple anal, right?</p>
      
        <p>So she had three dicks in her asshole.</p>
      
        <p>So I asked Asa,</p>
      
        <p>Asa, how much money did you make?</p>
      
        <p>She goes, oh my God, that's personal.</p>
      
        <p>Personal?</p>
      
        <p>You have three dicks in your asshole, right?</p>
      
        <p>But she's right.</p>
      
        <p>She's absolutely right.</p>
      
        <p>Because money is the number one most taboo subject matter.</p>
      
        <p>Then sex is number two.</p>
      
        <p>I think that's why Jeffrey Epstein was such a powerful person.</p>
      
        <p>Because he could manipulate billionaires with sex.</p>
      
        <p>He could manipulate Prince Andrew through money.</p>
      
        <p>Because when you feel comfortable talking about sex and money</p>
      
        <p>and you're an expert in the money and sex world,</p>
      
        <p>you are a very, very powerful person.</p>
      
        <p>And I think I love doing this show.</p>
      
        <p>And thank you for coming to the show</p>
      
        <p>because I think sometimes people get really nervous talking about sex.</p>
      
        <p>But it's good to talk about this.</p>
      
        <p>And if your sons or daughters or nephews or nieces</p>
      
        <p>know that you're comfortable with sex,</p>
      
        <p>they're always going to come to you for help.</p>
      
        <p>And I think this will make the world a better place.</p>
      
        <p>So before I go, if you think we live in a sad, lonely, perverted world,</p>
      
        <p>ladies and gentlemen, sometimes it takes a pervert to make a better world.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      
        <p>I hope you like the show.</p>
      
        <p>Can I ask a question?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, go ask.</p>
      
        <p>Can I take a quick...</p>
      
        <p>I've been taking pictures of everything during the show.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, please ask.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, you said at the podcast,</p>
      
        <p>I see this couple of us were sitting outside the queue.</p>
      
        <p>You said that porn is more pro-feminine than...</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if I have it correctly.</p>
      
        <p>I got in trouble for that, by the way.</p>
      
        <p>Did you? Oh.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>I say porn is more pro-women than fashion magazines.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why I say that,</p>
      
        <p>because if you look at porn magazines,</p>
      
        <p>what kind of women do they...</p>
      
        <p>First of all, fashion is run by whom?</p>
      
        <p>Gay men and women, right?</p>
      
        <p>And what kind of body type is that?</p>
      
        <p>They are almost like 5'10", 5'11", 6 feet and 110 pounds.</p>
      
        <p>They're very skinny.</p>
      
        <p>I work in porn business for 25 plus years.</p>
      
        <p>I have never heard any customer say,</p>
      
        <p>do you have a porn, she's 6 feet tall and 110 pounds?</p>
      
        <p>Never.</p>
      
        <p>But you know what, ladies?</p>
      
        <p>They always ask, do you have fat women, ugly women,</p>
      
        <p>women with one arm, women with facial hair?</p>
      
        <p>See, I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>You guys are beautiful.</p>
      
        <p>You always try to make yourself beautiful,</p>
      
        <p>but you're not doing for men.</p>
      
        <p>You're doing for other women.</p>
      
        <p>For real.</p>
      
        <p>We only care if you're naked.</p>
      
        <p>We don't care what you're wearing, to be honest, right?</p>
      
        <p>But to me, that's harsh,</p>
      
        <p>because I think so many women are starving themselves</p>
      
        <p>because they want to look like those fashion models.</p>
      
        <p>Can I say something?</p>
      
        <p>Most men don't even like women.</p>
      
        <p>They like thick women.</p>
      
        <p>We do.</p>
      
        <p>We like women with firm ass and tits.</p>
      
        <p>I work for John Stoliano, a butt man, Rocco's buddy.</p>
      
        <p>And yeah, so that's why I meant like a body type wise.</p>
      
        <p>I think porn is more pro-women because you have short women.</p>
      
        <p>Realistic.</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>Fashion is not realistic.</p>
      
        <p>You're this much tall and like 50 kilograms.</p>
      
        <p>That's crazy.</p>
      
        <p>That's why I say porn is more pro-women.</p>
      
        <p>How did you get in trouble for that?</p>
      
        <p>Somebody said, porn is anti-women.</p>
      
        <p>You shut your .</p>
