        <p>You don't have to remember the era where,</p>
      
        <p>there was something strange going on in America in the 90s</p>
      
        <p>because, you know, as you know, in the 90s,</p>
      
        <p>it was the end of the millennium.</p>
      
        <p>And whenever they come to the end of the new century or millennium,</p>
      
        <p>people do all kinds of weird.</p>
      
        <p>So there was a lot of weird shit going on in the United States, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I couldn't give you a detail.</p>
      
        <p>For some reason, back in the 90s when they were doing porn,</p>
      
        <p>whereas, you know, 70s and 80s, because of obscenity case,</p>
      
        <p>every movie had to have a story and some kind of educational value.</p>
      
        <p>Well, once they was like, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>You have to have some kind of educated or something creative.</p>
      
        <p>There was a case in late 80s where</p>
      
        <p>that's Los Angeles County went after a pornographer</p>
      
        <p>and the pornographer won the case.</p>
      
        <p>So what happened, they sent message to the rest of the country</p>
      
        <p>where pornographers from New York and San Francisco</p>
      
        <p>were having a lot of issues.</p>
      
        <p>They decided to move to LA.</p>
      
        <p>And there was a reason why I was telling that.</p>
      
        <p>Except for...</p>
      
        <p>All alone.</p>
      
        <p>What's that?</p>
      
        <p>Anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So from 90s on, they just started making movies</p>
      
        <p>where there's no educational value or stories.</p>
      
        <p>That's where my boss, John Steele,</p>
      
        <p>John Steele, aka, Buttman,</p>
      
        <p>he makes movies with women and big asses,</p>
      
        <p>changed the business.</p>
      
        <p>He started doing this thing called gonzo porn,</p>
      
        <p>which is just like in Contra S. Thompson,</p>
      
        <p>who is a very famous American author that Johnny Depp liked,</p>
      
        <p>Fear and Loathing in Vegas,</p>
      
        <p>where the journalist is the part of the story.</p>
      
        <p>So when he's filming porn as a gonzo pornographer,</p>
      
        <p>John, aka, Buttman is part of the story.</p>
      
        <p>And that became very, very popular from 80s to 90s.</p>
      
        <p>But around mid-90s,</p>
      
        <p>around the time when extreme sports was getting popular,</p>
      
        <p>they started doing a lot of extreme porn stuff</p>
      
        <p>that wasn't really safe.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, I knew a lady named Annabelle Chung.</p>
      
        <p>She did like first 200,</p>
      
        <p>Game Bang with 200 guys.</p>
      
        <p>And then...</p>
      
        <p>Just Men St. Clair did like 300 ones.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>In one sitting, that's what you're saying.</p>
      
        <p>Yes, but...</p>
      
        <p>We're probably wrong term.</p>
      
        <p>We're probably wrong term theater sitting.</p>
      
        <p>This is how anal I am because...</p>
      
        <p>I went to one of those things with other people,</p>
      
        <p>and like, this is a fucking lie.</p>
      
        <p>Because what they happen is,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes a guy with multiple scenes counts like three times.</p>
      
        <p>That's not three guys.</p>
      
        <p>That's fucking...</p>
      
        <p>They cheated on the one right there.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, so I was getting kind of angry because...</p>
      
        <p>I have to do two, two, five, seven,</p>
      
        <p>and keep track and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, yes, it's ridiculous that I expect honesty in pornography</p>
      
        <p>like a CPA or something like that.</p>
      
        <p>So they were doing all kinds of weird stuff.</p>
      
        <p>And I have a little question.</p>
      
        <p>Who...</p>
      
        <p>So porn had to be educational value.</p>
      
        <p>Is that...</p>
      
        <p>To protect from obscenity case, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Who has the job to decide where to porn it?</p>
      
        <p>Like, who is deciding that?</p>
      
        <p>Well, district attorney, and they have to ask...</p>
      
        <p>No, district attorney, juror of the community.</p>
      
        <p>What, 12 of your peers?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, really.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, that's...</p>
      
        <p>That really comes down to that.</p>
      
        <p>So they're like, I've learned something.</p>
      
        <p>But you...</p>
      
        <p>But you got to remember,</p>
      
        <p>this kind of stuff's kind of stunning in Europe</p>
      
        <p>because for centuries, it wasn't obscenity case,</p>
      
        <p>it was blasphemy,</p>
      
        <p>where you did something against God and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>And it was...</p>
      
        <p>That was going for, like, millenniums in Europe.</p>
      
        <p>And then...</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, when...</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of funny to say this country,</p>
      
        <p>but when someone like Nietzsche said God is dead,</p>
      
        <p>blasphemy and the religious stuff no longer was relevant</p>
      
        <p>because most educated Europeans stopped not believing in God.</p>
      
        <p>So what's the other thing that the state could go after someone?</p>
      
        <p>The anti-God and anti-religious stuff?</p>
      
        <p>The anti-God and anti-religious stuff was replaced by obscenity.</p>
      
        <p>So you have a situation like James Joyce Ulysses</p>
      
        <p>or Lady Shelley's Lovers</p>
      
        <p>where government are going after people by obscenity cases.</p>
      
        <p>And that's not really spread to the United States.</p>
      
        <p>And 1969, Curious Yellow...</p>
      
        <p>Yep, 69, let's go.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>All right, no one?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, cool, let's just...</p>
      
        <p>Nice.</p>
      
        <p>The year I was born,</p>
      
        <p>Denmark legalized pornography.</p>
      
        <p>In 69.</p>
      
        <p>And then...</p>
      
        <p>Charm and Tribulation.</p>
      
        <p>Because back then, if you put pornography as a documentary,</p>
      
        <p>you're technically protected in New York City.</p>
      
        <p>And it was just like a huge business in New York</p>
      
        <p>because Nickelodeon, you know, you put a recorder,</p>
      
        <p>you watch a show, they start putting pornography in.</p>
      
        <p>So New York City, Manhattan, because hotbed,</p>
      
        <p>eventually just spread to places like San Francisco and L.A.</p>
      
        <p>But each city had a different kind of style of pornography, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Different stories.</p>
      
        <p>Well, this going to channel,</p>
      
        <p>this is where you miss the market there.</p>
      
        <p>New York City was very, very dark and edgy.</p>
      
        <p>San Francisco was more academic and creative story.</p>
      
        <p>And L.A. was very like, you know, like California girl, blonde hair, big boobs,</p>
      
        <p>kind of fun kind of thing, you know.</p>
