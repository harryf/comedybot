    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>you see ass, like, put a smile on our</p>
      
        <p>faces, right? I mean,</p>
      
        <p>I'm just saying, it's hard to be angry when</p>
      
        <p>you see</p>
      
        <p>pussy, tits, and ass, okay, anyway.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean? So,</p>
      
        <p>so that's the one thing,</p>
      
        <p>the power of porn,</p>
      
        <p>and, um,</p>
      
        <p>I'm, um,</p>
      
        <p>I'm just saying,</p>
      
        <p>I'm just saying my life.</p>
      
        <p>Now, um,</p>
      
        <p>so,</p>
      
        <p>I have another complicated</p>
      
        <p>reason because my, my, um,</p>
      
        <p>very typical Asian family,</p>
      
        <p>my mother was forced to marry my dad.</p>
      
        <p>Ladies, imagine you're like 17, 18,</p>
      
        <p>you know what I mean, you're forced to marry somebody</p>
      
        <p>you don't want to marry,</p>
      
        <p>and, um, she didn't want to marry my dad,</p>
      
        <p>And every time my mom sees my face, it's a painful reminder of her unhappiness.</p>
      
        <p>That's not fun.</p>
      
        <p>And one time I remember, this is one of the many reasons why you should sneak up on your parents.</p>
      
        <p>Because one time I couldn't sleep, I went downstairs, kind of sneaked down like a ninja.</p>
      
        <p>Just like Harry could see me sitting over there.</p>
      
        <p>Now, I went downstairs, and you know, I'm not trying to get your sympathy, but my mom was drunk, she was upset, she was talking to her friend.</p>
      
        <p>And this is what she said to her friend, you know, my mom didn't see me.</p>
      
        <p>She just said, every time she sees my face, she wants to kill herself.</p>
      
        <p>You know.</p>
      
        <p>Oh my goodness.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why it keeps me hard on.</p>
      
        <p>But anyway, so anyway, you know, I'm very talented.</p>
      
        <p>Now, so yeah, it's interesting.</p>
      
        <p>It doesn't make me feel good, but this is the reality I live in.</p>
      
        <p>So I remember one time, middle of the night, my parents are fighting again.</p>
      
        <p>And my brother's younger, and he's more like a kinder version of me.</p>
      
        <p>He ran up and tried to stop my mom and my dad fighting.</p>
      
        <p>And my mom's trying to stab my dad, you know, which is, you know, reverse OJ.</p>
      
        <p>And so every time I see stuff like that, I fucking panic.</p>
      
        <p>So I went downstairs.</p>
      
        <p>I'm trying to hide.</p>
      
        <p>And this is what I always do.</p>
      
        <p>And when I go to my mom, my dad's library, he has big books.</p>
      
        <p>You know, they're big.</p>
      
        <p>So each book I open, put another one book over here open, put a book on top of it.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm trying to make like a little castle.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm trying to make a place for me to hide.</p>
      
        <p>And I run out of books.</p>
      
        <p>And I need, I'm inside, I need a couple more books so I can hide in there.</p>
      
        <p>And finally I notice in the top corner shelf, there's three books I never noticed before.</p>
      
        <p>Big books, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So I put a chair, got the books.</p>
      
        <p>I'm inside.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to hide.</p>
      
        <p>And it's written in like a really weird language.</p>
      
        <p>It's not Japanese.</p>
      
        <p>So I open the book.</p>
      
        <p>It's one of those really fancy like French, erotic photograph.</p>
      
        <p>So there's like naked white people, right?</p>
      
        <p>And I was amazed.</p>
      
        <p>Because at that point, living in Japan, I'd never seen foreigners.</p>
      
        <p>I thought white people, blacks, and Latinos, this is like imaginary creatures.</p>
      
        <p>Like not real.</p>
      
        <p>Because I never saw any of them.</p>
      
        <p>I thought, oh, this is like a black person.</p>
      
        <p>This is like a white person.</p>
      
        <p>Like not real.</p>
      
        <p>Because I've never seenâ€¦</p>
      
        <p>All I see is Asians, right?</p>
      
        <p>I've never seen people like you guys.</p>
      
        <p>So I knew Godzilla was real.</p>
      
        <p>But I thought white people are not real either, right?</p>
      
        <p>So I open.</p>
      
        <p>They're having sex, but I don't know what that is.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>So I was just like, what is this?</p>
      
        <p>And here's how dumb I am.</p>
      
        <p>Anybody old enough to remember back in 6th grade?</p>
      
        <p>I went to another place.</p>
      
        <p>I thought, oh, this is like a white person.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, wow.</p>
      
        <p>So I was just like, what is this?</p>
      
        <p>And this is how dumb I am.</p>
      
        <p>Anybody old enough to remember back in the 60s, 70s, 80s?</p>
      
        <p>They used to put stars on nipples and vagina and penis.</p>
      
        <p>Do you remember those?</p>
      
        <p>Anybody remember those?</p>
      
        <p>No.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, you remember.</p>
      
        <p>Sometimes when they're doing not explicit pornography,</p>
      
        <p>they put stars to cover them, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, yeah, they put stars.</p>
      
        <p>They put stars on nipples and vagina, asshole, and dick,</p>
      
        <p>and things like that.</p>
      
        <p>This is how dumb I am.</p>
      
        <p>I thought they had stars all the time.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>That's what I thought.</p>
      
        <p>Like, these are aliens, right?</p>
      
        <p>That's what...</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, the thing that really surprised me,</p>
      
        <p>it wasn't the sex because I was too young to understand.</p>
      
        <p>You know the thing that really shocked me?</p>
      
        <p>Whenever there was a picture of these people kissing and hugging each other,</p>
      
        <p>I've never seen my parents do that.</p>
      
        <p>So when I saw those pictures, I was like, I don't know what this is.</p>
      
        <p>This looks wonderful.</p>
      
        <p>I wish my parents would do that.</p>
      
        <p>Because they're always fighting, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, hugging, kissing, I think this...</p>
      
        <p>I've never seen anybody do it.</p>
      
        <p>Because in Japan, we don't do that stuff, you know?</p>
      
        <p>We don't.</p>
      
        <p>We don't show public affection in public, you know?</p>
      
        <p>We do tentacle porn.</p>
      
        <p>So, from a young age, I had a really, I don't know,</p>
      
        <p>like a positive attitude of porn.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't think it was a really, really bad thing.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>When I got older and my family had a financial problem,</p>
      
        <p>one of my friends told me how much money they were making, you know?</p>
      
        <p>This is like pre-internet.</p>
      
        <p>Imagine a porn shop this size, and there's little hallways where there's booths.</p>
      
        <p>People put quarters to watch porn.</p>
      
        <p>Because ladies, you want to know, like, why would you do that, right?</p>
      
        <p>Because when men were married, 90s and 80s, they don't want to take porn home, right?</p>
      
        <p>Because they're going to get into trouble with their wives and girlfriends.</p>
      
        <p>So what they do is, they go in the morning, and they go to the bathroom, and they go to the bathroom.</p>
      
        <p>They go in the morning before work, put quarters to watch a movie, masturbate.</p>
      
        <p>They sometimes come during lunchtime, and sometimes they come over during dinnertime.</p>
      
        <p>It's very lonely, but people do that all the time.</p>
      
        <p>Now, you probably want to know, somebody has to clean those booths, right?</p>
      
        <p>Well, you're looking at him.</p>
      
        <p>Now...</p>
      
        <p>You know, it's not the visual that bothers me, it's the smell, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know...</p>
      
        <p>After a while, you don't even notice it.</p>
      
        <p>You don't even notice things, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, I mop with one hand, and eat clam chowder with the other hand.</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
      
        <p>So I got used to it.</p>
      
        <p>That's my life, right?</p>
      
        <p>And working at the shop, I think, it was like my college education, in Perversity 101.</p>
      
        <p>I think I learned a lot about people.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, I'm really uncomfortably silent.</p>
      
        <p>Okay, anyway...</p>
      
        <p>I'm uncomfortable, too.</p>
      
        <p>Alright, um...</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
