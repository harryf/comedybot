        <p>You know, like, give me some of my, you get a little bit of an idea of my personality.</p>
      
        <p>Seven, eight years ago, my roommate, Rick, Irish-American guy, it's been his lifetime dream to go to Japan.</p>
      
        <p>So he went.</p>
      
        <p>So the only thing I have to do is take care of the apartment.</p>
      
        <p>And nothing happened to his cat, Juanito.</p>
      
        <p>Well, here's the thing.</p>
      
        <p>As I'm walking out of the apartment one night, and this is a couple of days away from Fourth of July National Holiday in the USA.</p>
      
        <p>Huge explosion.</p>
      
        <p>The goddamn thing.</p>
      
        <p>I saw the cat run an apartment.</p>
      
        <p>I lost the cat.</p>
      
        <p>And I really didn't know what to do.</p>
      
        <p>I mean, he's not married.</p>
      
        <p>He doesn't have a girlfriend.</p>
      
        <p>But this is his child, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm panicking.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know what to do.</p>
      
        <p>And this is what Rick's mom said.</p>
      
        <p>Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son and you don't give him opportunity to look for the cat, he's going to resent you.</p>
      
        <p>So I think you should tell him that you lost the cat.</p>
      
        <p>So I thought about it.</p>
      
        <p>You know what?</p>
      
        <p>Rick's mom's right.</p>
      
        <p>So I emailed him.</p>
      
        <p>And because of time difference, he finally called me 14 hours later.</p>
      
        <p>Have you ever had a conversation with somebody who's been clearly been crying for a long time?</p>
      
        <p>That wasn't the funny part.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Wow, that's the German audience.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat, but I got to say something here.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my God.</p>
      
        <p>He's going to ask you to move out.</p>
      
        <p>He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat?</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm not Chinese.</p>
      
        <p>I'm from Japan.</p>
      
        <p>We're only our lord and savior.</p>
      
        <p>Hello, kitty.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway.</p>
      
        <p>So the next 14 days, I'm going crazy.</p>
      
        <p>Midnight, 3 a.m., 6, 9.</p>
      
        <p>You got it.</p>
      
        <p>Like every three hours.</p>
      
        <p>I'm walking around like a crazy lady in the neighborhood, shaking the cat food, saying,</p>
      
        <p>Juanito, looking for the goddamn cat.</p>
      
        <p>And it's getting closer and closer.</p>
      
        <p>And then within a couple of days, my friend's going to return.</p>
      
        <p>So I went to my friend, ADF.</p>
      
        <p>He has a very popular podcast at the time.</p>
      
        <p>He said, can I get on the pod, big people to help me look for the cat?</p>
      
        <p>So I went on.</p>
      
        <p>Please, if you live nearby Hollywood in Edgemont, if you want to volunteer to look for the cat,</p>
      
        <p>please help me.</p>
      
        <p>And better yet, if you find the cat, please contact me.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm like, okay.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm going to go to the cat food.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to go to the cat food.</p>
      
        <p>This is where I made a mistake, because I live in the USA.</p>
      
        <p>I give my personal cell phone number on the podcast.</p>
      
        <p>So I think 70,000 people downloaded that week.</p>
      
        <p>After a couple hours, somebody texts me saying, Yoshi, I think I found your cat.</p>
      
        <p>I'm like, oh no!</p>
      
        <p>and I clicked the picture and it's a picture of a huge cock.</p>
      
        <p>Even after we found the cat,</p>
      
        <p>thank God when Rick drove in with his motorcycle,</p>
      
        <p>the goddamn cat reappeared.</p>
      
        <p>Everything's fine.</p>
      
        <p>But these motherfuckers will always text me</p>
      
        <p>their dick pictures on national holidays.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, fall to July,</p>
      
        <p>Halloween, they will put pumpkin on top of his head.</p>
      
        <p>You know, Christmas, like a little bit of a Christmas ornament.</p>
      
        <p>And, you know, even on 9-11,</p>
      
        <p>they will put NYPD blue helmet on top of his dick.</p>
      
        <p>And of course, I salute.</p>
      
        <p>So there's something...</p>
      
        <p>There's something about my personality.</p>
