        <p>I know you're wrong, but if your son's dying, let this chick give him a blowjob.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Is this wrong?</p>
      
        <p>It's coming from a good place.</p>
      
        <p>Don't let your son die like a boy, let him die like a man.</p>
      
        <p>Am I wrong about this?</p>
      
        <p>Isn't that important for guys?</p>
      
        <p>At 16?</p>
      
        <p>Hell yeah.</p>
      
        <p>At 16?</p>
      
        <p>Why did you make him laugh with that question?</p>
      
        <p>In America, if the parent gives permission, kids could get married.</p>
      
        <p>Even at a young age, providing they get permission from both parents, they could get married underage.</p>
      
        <p>So if you could do that, and if the kid is dying, just because we feel uncomfortable, I think it's wrong to let them die.</p>
      
        <p>And if that's what they really want to do before they're dead, I think it's wrong not to do that for them.</p>
      
        <p>It's coming from a good place.</p>
      
        <p>Just because we feel uncomfortable, so you should let somebody suck his dick because he might suck the cancer out of him.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>Is this wrong?</p>
      
        <p>It's a good thing he's not here because otherwise he would be like, I have cancer.</p>
      
        <p>But usually also...</p>
      
        <p>And somebody asked me, how would you feel if your son is dying from cancer and he's gay?</p>
      
        <p>This is the kind of father I am.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to give him the biggest, biggest, black gay cock for my son.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>I'll stretch my son's ass wide open.</p>
      
        <p>But you know, fuck my son, right?</p>
      
        <p>Because I'm homophobic.</p>
      
        <p>If my son's gay and dying, then...</p>
      
        <p>You know, I think that's only a good father would do that.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry, I think about this shit every fucking day.</p>
      
        <p>So you're saying your son...</p>
      
        <p>If my shitty DNA gave my son cancer, I think that's the very least I should do.</p>
      
        <p>Any questions right now?</p>
      
        <p>Any questions?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, please.</p>
      
        <p>This is why I'm...</p>
      
        <p>So you said you went to many different countries, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like Sweden?</p>
      
        <p>Afghanistan?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah, check this.</p>
      
        <p>So do you see any countries that are more open?</p>
      
        <p>That are generally...</p>
      
        <p>That they have a culture that is...</p>
      
        <p>This is an excellent question.</p>
      
        <p>And based on all the places I have been to,</p>
      
        <p>in my personal opinion,</p>
      
        <p>women who are the most confident, and they're very honest,</p>
      
        <p>and they're assertive,</p>
      
        <p>and they have a happy sex life, in my opinion,</p>
      
        <p>going to all those places,</p>
      
        <p>it's Dutch women.</p>
      
        <p>Because I notice most countries...</p>
      
        <p>Hugo is Dutch.</p>
      
        <p>Oh!</p>
      
        <p>I've never had a Dutch girlfriend.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why I find the Netherlands to be an amazing place,</p>
      
        <p>it's because most countries have one thing,</p>
      
        <p>but not both.</p>
      
        <p>So if prostitution is legal, porn is illegal.</p>
      
        <p>If porn is legal, prostitution is legal.</p>
      
        <p>Or, worst scenario,</p>
      
        <p>both are legal.</p>
      
        <p>But the Netherlands has both of those things.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not suggesting having porn necessarily means a good thing,</p>
      
        <p>but what I think it is,</p>
      
        <p>you have a society where you give women</p>
      
        <p>the freedom to make a bad decision to do porn.</p>
      
        <p>See, more freedom,</p>
      
        <p>more choices for women,</p>
      
        <p>is a better place.</p>
      
        <p>And because of the sex education in the Netherlands,</p>
      
        <p>that's one thing I noticed,</p>
      
        <p>they're very confident and assertive, you know?</p>
      
        <p>And I really like how parents approach sex,</p>
      
        <p>and like education,</p>
      
        <p>with a lot of pragmatism, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Having said that,</p>
      
        <p>the country that really shocked me in terms of</p>
