        <p>I don't know, but guys, I've got to come straight with you, I'm not really in the mood to do comedy today because last week I went on a company retreat.</p>
      
        <p>And nothing makes you want to retreat your company like a company retreat.</p>
      
        <p>And we had to work on it.</p>
      
        <p>We had to work on our company values. Who here works at a company with values?</p>
      
        <p>What is that shit? Like honestly, why are these companies pretending to be nice?</p>
      
        <p>It's always the same, they're like, here at Evil Corporation, we believe in diversity and inclusion and...</p>
      
        <p>I mean sustainability, I mean sustainability guys.</p>
      
        <p>So we're working, and I'm in this workshop, and some idiot on the workshop came up with this company value, they were like, we before I.</p>
      
        <p>And I thought to myself, yeah, but what about who before gives a fuck?</p>
      
        <p>That is my kind of company value.</p>
