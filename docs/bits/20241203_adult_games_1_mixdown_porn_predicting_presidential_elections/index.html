    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>So you asked me like shit. I mean, sometimes there's, you know, like there's, there's,</p>
      
        <p>there's sometimes like what the people, ladies have, uh, ejaculation and sometimes there's</p>
      
        <p>accident. So yeah, so I did kind of, there is some shit. Literally, I land on top of it.</p>
      
        <p>Now, comedians, American comedians, if you take your store, like they laugh because they want you</p>
      
        <p>to suffer. And because European comedians are so nice, they're such a sweet people. But American</p>
      
        <p>comedians are so nice, they're such a sweet people. But American comedians are so nice, they're such a sweet people. But American</p>
      
        <p>comedians, when they see their other comedians go up, they want them to do really bad and suffer.</p>
      
        <p>And if you do really bad, they laugh at you. But porn people are very, very nice, you know, despite some</p>
      
        <p>reputations. So when I flip on top of it, they feel bad because, you know, I'm all sticky with my hair, my</p>
      
        <p>back and jeans, you know, and I don't want them, I don't want them to feel bad for me. So I did fucking</p>
      
        <p>snow angel, you know what I mean? You know when you have snow, of course, you don't, you don't know about that.</p>
      
        <p>And when I saw that in Scotland, like, no Yoshi, that's calm angel. Well, thank you very much, sir.</p>
      
        <p>This is a very confusing audience because you laugh at part of us, but it was just from being sensitive.</p>
      
        <p>So Canada thing, okay. God, this is terrible.</p>
      
        <p>I was just crying more because I actually have to go and teach children tomorrow and I'm coming from a gay sauna where a prostitute</p>
      
        <p>is happening. So that was very much related.</p>
      
        <p>Well, first of all, you don't have to say gay sauna, it's understood.</p>
      
        <p>Sauna is kind of gay, let's be honest.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, I want to show you for a few minutes.</p>
      
        <p>Are you stigmatizing me? It's fine, I'm doing it.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no, no. This country is too small for you.</p>
      
        <p>I know, honey. Take me to New York.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no, you have such a perfect personality.</p>
      
        <p>No, seriously. You're around fucking New York City.</p>
      
        <p>I'm very anti-social.</p>
      
        <p>Let's cope up. Let's match up together.</p>
      
        <p>We go to a dive bar, we make the women clear for you.</p>
      
        <p>What's funny is like, it would be funny if you and I did a podcast in New York City or something, you know.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, oh, but so the shitting things, you know, I don't like that.</p>
      
        <p>Obviously I don't like shit.</p>
      
        <p>But yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Somebody asked me, one of the porn girls, I remember, Bella Donna,</p>
      
        <p>women are amazing. The things that you can do with your body, and women have a keen sense of smell.</p>
      
        <p>But you know, Bella Donna told me one time, she smelled this guy's dick, and she thought, oh my god, you have gonorrhea.</p>
      
        <p>Isn't that amazing?</p>
      
        <p>That's like a cop whisperer, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, because I don't know how she knew, but like there's certain distinct smell.</p>
      
        <p>So I asked, like, what does a gonorrhea smell like?</p>
      
        <p>And she told me, imagine used diaper, sit in hot sun for like two weeks.</p>
      
        <p>It smells a lot worse than that.</p>
      
        <p>Another time, somebody pissed in her mouth.</p>
      
        <p>And right away she knew the guy had diabetes.</p>
      
        <p>Because, I don't know why I'm looking at you, but the piss tastes like too sweet.</p>
      
        <p>I know.</p>
      
        <p>In view of the United States health cost, it's come to me, I tell you.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, but isn't it amazing, like, just the smell and the taste, you know, that they could figure things out.</p>
      
        <p>So like, you know, on one hand, you know, I think, I'm very grateful because I learned all kinds of shit that in any normal society,</p>
      
        <p>in any normal circumstance, you wouldn't find them.</p>
      
        <p>But Canada, what happened was, I was hoping for this really big meeting in Canada.</p>
      
        <p>I flew in.</p>
      
        <p>And what I do is, because I work in DVD department, I have a check desk.</p>
      
        <p>Check desks are basically one step before you make final product.</p>
      
        <p>So in check desks, you know, you go, if you push up arrow, it goes up.</p>
      
        <p>If you push down, it goes down.</p>
      
        <p>And make sure the sound sync with everything.</p>
      
        <p>So you check everything, and if everything's okay, you make final product.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, I'm not sure.</p>
      
        <p>So I have a bunch of final product, a bunch of check desks that you can't sell if I could give it away for a friend.</p>
      
        <p>So I went to Canada one time, bagged for a check desk, right?</p>
      
        <p>For whatever reason, when I'm getting at the airport, all the customs stopped me.</p>
      
        <p>So they stopped me, and they went into the customs room, and I had bagged for a porn.</p>
      
        <p>Now, porn is legal.</p>
      
        <p>That wasn't the problem.</p>
      
        <p>Here's the problem.</p>
      
        <p>That week, Michael Jackson got accused for molestation for the second time.</p>
      
        <p>So as a joke, in my joke notebook, I wrote Michael Jackson's favorite child porn titles.</p>
      
        <p>You know where I'm going with it?</p>
      
        <p>So when they went into the room, go through my bag, they found a bunch of DVDs.</p>
      
        <p>I said, what's that?</p>
      
        <p>And I'm an honest guy.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, oh, I wrote the porn company, I just checked this.</p>
      
        <p>And the guy opened my joke notebook.</p>
      
        <p>He opened exactly that page with child porn titles, right?</p>
      
        <p>By the way, child porn sounds mean.</p>
      
        <p>I like to call it child erotica.</p>
      
        <p>So anyway, so he sees titles like, you know, like, what was it?</p>
      
        <p>Kindergarten Conk, SpongeBob, No Pants, Hairless in Seattle, Honey, I Fucked a Kid, Wait Till</p>
      
        <p>Your Father Gets Hard, Four Year Old Bird.</p>
      
        <p>You get the idea.</p>
      
        <p>Muck the Magic Drugs.</p>
      
        <p>So he...</p>
      
        <p>They fucking see like 50 child porn titles.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>And I'm like, oh my, oh my God.</p>
      
        <p>I'm in trouble because...</p>
      
        <p>So I tell them like, have you ever heard a scenario where a guy got caught with child</p>
      
        <p>porn?</p>
      
        <p>He has a child, movies, child porn, and they have funny titles?</p>
      
        <p>Never.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, you think they catch a serial killer, they say it was a nice guy.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not a serial killer.</p>
      
        <p>First of all, I'm not a white guy.</p>
      
        <p>And plus, and I'm black.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not a white guy.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a black guy.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a white guy.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not the profile.</p>
      
        <p>So if you have a funny child title, clearly I'm joking, but this motherfucker accustomed,</p>
      
        <p>no fucking sense of humor.</p>
      
        <p>They're saying like, you gotta see a judge.</p>
      
        <p>So they gave me two choices.</p>
