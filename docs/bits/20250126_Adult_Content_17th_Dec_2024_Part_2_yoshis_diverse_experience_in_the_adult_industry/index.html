        <p>Let me kick off with a question for Yoshi on this one.</p>
      
        <p>So you've worked in kind of like the whole aspect of the porn industry.</p>
      
        <p>If you have to think about which part you enjoyed the most, so from smuggling dirty</p>
      
        <p>magazines to selling porn to young gay boys to...</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>Looking for the right moment to whack on a videotape, which part was the one that you</p>
      
        <p>actually enjoyed the most?</p>
      
        <p>Maybe I'm not answering your question, but I was in jail one time.</p>
      
        <p>Which side of the bars?</p>
      
        <p>September 11.</p>
      
        <p>Wait.</p>
      
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
      
        <p>2003.</p>
      
        <p>All right.</p>
      
        <p>I was going up to Washington State because my cousin passed away and my dad passed away</p>
      
        <p>maybe a month before that.</p>
      
        <p>So I wasn't particularly in a good mental state and I took the wrong bag.</p>
      
        <p>And remember when I stayed I had a big circle because I bought a shoplifter or whatever?</p>
      
        <p>So after that I got a collapsible baton, which is like a little stick when you go like this</p>
      
        <p>and become big.</p>
      
        <p>Well, I can't remember.</p>
      
        <p>I don't remember.</p>
      
        <p>I gotta teach you some information.</p>
      
        <p>Just to give you some hints.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, it was a reallyribble society.</p>
      
        <p>We had no pantyhose on.</p>
      
        <p>It was in the school√≥washande</p>
      
        <p>questo.</p>
      
        <p>That's true.</p>
      
        <p>Does it still happen now?</p>
      
        <p>No, it hasn't.</p>
      
        <p>It's really bad because all the blacks in one corner, all the whites, all the Latinos,</p>
      
        <p>and you know, Asians really don't commit a lot of crimes.</p>
      
        <p>So I'm in the corner with me and a guy in a women's outfit and a Samoan guy.</p>
      
        <p>So it was a really, really bad situation.</p>
      
        <p>Only reason I didn't get hurt because I was wearing a Buttman t-shirt or Belladonna t-shirt.</p>
      
        <p>I can't remember what I was wearing.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, one of the black guys said, hey, what did you get done?</p>
      
        <p>I work.</p>
