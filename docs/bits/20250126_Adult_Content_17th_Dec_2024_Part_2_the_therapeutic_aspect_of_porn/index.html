        <p>I also like, honestly, sometimes when people feel embarrassed, I tell them I'm a pervert or whatever.</p>
      
        <p>And people are afraid to ask this question.</p>
      
        <p>I had a client at Taboo.</p>
      
        <p>She's a Holocaust survivor.</p>
      
        <p>Her husband passed away.</p>
      
        <p>She never grew up in an environment where people use that kind of language.</p>
      
        <p>They say, I want you to touch me this way and that.</p>
      
        <p>They never had that.</p>
      
        <p>And I think...</p>
      
        <p>I know it sounds like a really goofy thing to say, but I think happy sex and orgasm is a human right.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's a part of happiness, you know?</p>
      
        <p>But it wasn't that her husband was bad.</p>
      
        <p>It's just they grew up in a generation.</p>
      
        <p>You just never talk about these things.</p>
      
        <p>Right?</p>
      
        <p>Like even for most of the people here, especially younger, what does our parents always say?</p>
      
        <p>No kids, no kids, no kids for years.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a grandkid.</p>
      
        <p>What the fuck?</p>
      
        <p>Like you said, that's a huge leap, isn't it?</p>
      
        <p>So you need people like me because sometimes my friend's kids...</p>
      
        <p>You need people like me.</p>
      
        <p>Sometimes my friend's kids, when they were younger, email me, like, I heard you work in porn.</p>
      
        <p>I have a question.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not afraid talking about it.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not expert.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know how to do women orgasm.</p>
      
        <p>That's a problem.</p>
      
        <p>But I'm not afraid to talk to kids.</p>
      
        <p>But I'll still...</p>
      
        <p>I'll still talk to my friend's kids.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I don't mind talking to you, but I don't feel good about behind their back talking to you.</p>
      
        <p>So you should talk to your parents.</p>
      
        <p>And if you're afraid, you get permission from your parents if you talk to me.</p>
      
        <p>Because I don't want...</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I don't want...</p>
      
        <p>If you're an adult, I don't want to make anybody embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>You know?</p>
      
        <p>That's why I make the most ridiculous person.</p>
      
        <p>Because a lot of people say, well, why would this person judge me?</p>
      
        <p>He's a scumbag at a porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>So you should talk to me.</p>
      
        <p>To help people was what really was fun part.</p>
