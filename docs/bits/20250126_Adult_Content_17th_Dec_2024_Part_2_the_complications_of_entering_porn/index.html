    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>every time I talk to my porn guys,</p>
      
        <p>which particular regional country</p>
      
        <p>where women are contacting for sex,</p>
      
        <p>it's really surprising.</p>
      
        <p>It's always India, Pakistan,</p>
      
        <p>and the Bangladesh area.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know why that is,</p>
      
        <p>but they're really, really aggressive, you know?</p>
      
        <p>You just said</p>
      
        <p>they make...</p>
      
        <p>You just said something like,</p>
      
        <p>make a bad decision if women go into porn.</p>
      
        <p>Do you think it's a bad decision</p>
      
        <p>for women to go into porn?</p>
      
        <p>No, um...</p>
      
        <p>When I got into business,</p>
      
        <p>Canada wasn't a big thing,</p>
      
        <p>so I knew a lot of my friends</p>
      
        <p>were from Eastern Europe.</p>
      
        <p>You know, thinking back then was,</p>
      
        <p>they would film stuff in the States,</p>
      
        <p>the chance of them getting copies in Eastern Europe,</p>
      
        <p>highly unlikely,</p>
      
        <p>they come from very poor countries</p>
      
        <p>after the post-Cold War,</p>
      
        <p>so this was like once-in-life</p>
      
        <p>generational wealth for a lot of them.</p>
      
        <p>So once from the early 90s,</p>
      
        <p>they made so much money</p>
      
        <p>that they were able to go back to</p>
      
        <p>Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania,</p>
      
        <p>and that money</p>
      
        <p>really changed their life</p>
      
        <p>for their families for the generations to come.</p>
      
        <p>So in situations like that,</p>
      
        <p>I think it's great,</p>
      
        <p>but I think when I see American girls,</p>
      
        <p>it's, yes,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes it's a money thing,</p>
      
        <p>but it's more complicated than that.</p>
      
        <p>And two, once you do porn,</p>
      
        <p>as you know, you can never go back,</p>
      
        <p>like people see you, but you know how difficult it is?</p>
      
        <p>Imagine you're 18,</p>
      
        <p>and you're not planning to go to school</p>
      
        <p>to become a dentist,</p>
      
        <p>or whatever, you're an engineer,</p>
      
        <p>and you're making $1,500, $2,000 per scene,</p>
      
        <p>and three years later,</p>
      
        <p>you quit.</p>
      
        <p>You honestly think you could go work at Starbucks</p>
      
        <p>at $8 an hour?</p>
      
        <p>This is a very, very difficult thing.</p>
      
        <p>A lot of these girls worked for like</p>
      
        <p>three, four, five, six years back then,</p>
      
        <p>and they fucking never paid taxes.</p>
      
        <p>Uncle Simon</p>
      
        <p>won their money, so</p>
      
        <p>they're getting in a bit of a financial situation.</p>
      
        <p>I got an argument with people running</p>
      
        <p>the porn industry, like</p>
      
        <p>there should be a retirement plan,</p>
      
        <p>post-porn programs</p>
      
        <p>to help them transition into, you know,</p>
      
        <p>unless they marry a rich guy,</p>
      
        <p>so I was really concerned for them, but</p>
      
        <p>it's</p>
      
        <p>it's a difficult</p>
      
        <p>and now, with the OnlyFans</p>
      
        <p>and Instagram, it's a completely different business.</p>
      
        <p>It's hard for me to understand</p>
      
        <p>that new business,</p>
      
        <p>because they're not really porno.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I'm so old school,</p>
      
        <p>like, they don't really love what they do.</p>
      
        <p>They're attention whores, and I just want whore.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, wow.</p>
