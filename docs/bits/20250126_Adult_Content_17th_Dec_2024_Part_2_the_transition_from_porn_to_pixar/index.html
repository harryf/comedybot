        <p>is there...</p>
      
        <p>Is there still something that gets you on in porn?</p>
      
        <p>And also, like, what was the thing...</p>
      
        <p>It's like my favorite fetish is</p>
      
        <p>when girls show up in time.</p>
      
        <p>They do their job.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my God.</p>
      
        <p>That should be a whole category.</p>
      
        <p>Every time there's a behind-the-scene...</p>
      
        <p>Like, my friend Aiden Starr,</p>
      
        <p>his porn where behind the scenes,</p>
      
        <p>he'll interview the girls.</p>
      
        <p>And after the scene...</p>
      
        <p>And I don't like when girls are porny.</p>
      
        <p>Like, good porn director, in my opinion,</p>
      
        <p>is look at somebody and think,</p>
      
        <p>I know what you're into,</p>
      
        <p>so we'll put you in a position</p>
      
        <p>where you do the fetish that you like,</p>
      
        <p>and so make you from above average to great.</p>
      
        <p>You know, that's the job of the director, right?</p>
      
        <p>But just size up a person,</p>
      
        <p>and, like, what are you into?</p>
      
        <p>What do you hate?</p>
      
        <p>You know, stuff like that.</p>
      
        <p>Well, so I don't like the porny shit.</p>
      
        <p>But Aiden, you know,</p>
      
        <p>he would talk to these girls, like,</p>
      
        <p>sometimes 45 minutes, 50 minutes,</p>
      
        <p>like, an hour behind the scenes.</p>
      
        <p>You know, you could fake</p>
      
        <p>an interview for, like, 10 minutes or something.</p>
      
        <p>But when somebody talks an hour or two hours,</p>
      
        <p>you stop becoming porny and be who you are.</p>
      
        <p>And I love hearing stuff about</p>
      
        <p>someone, somebody's being real about that stuff,</p>
      
        <p>you know, and I like that.</p>
      
        <p>But I don't like...</p>
      
        <p>I like when people are into stuff that they're into.</p>
      
        <p>I don't like forcing them to do stuff they don't like.</p>
      
        <p>That's not a turn-on for me.</p>
      
        <p>I know it is for you, but...</p>
      
        <p>You can tell.</p>
      
        <p>You like when the girls are crying.</p>
      
        <p>So, anyway.</p>
      
        <p>I don't even know what was the question.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, you know the thing.</p>
      
        <p>Any other questions in the room right now?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, you're like this.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, my.</p>
      
        <p>That was a good point.</p>
      
        <p>Do you know who I think is the most dangerous people on planet?</p>
      
        <p>It's based on what kind of porn they watch.</p>
      
        <p>In my opinion, most dangerous people on planet,</p>
      
        <p>are Chinese people.</p>
      
        <p>Because Chinese people watch the same kind of porn all the time.</p>
      
        <p>The porn that they like, based on all the customer head,</p>
      
        <p>Chinese people like watching porn where</p>
      
        <p>people are...</p>
      
        <p>They're fucking at work.</p>
      
        <p>Or they're fucking their bosses.</p>
      
        <p>Or they're doing the boat.</p>
      
        <p>This is really sick.</p>
      
        <p>Even in the fantasy time,</p>
      
        <p>Chinese people are thinking about work.</p>
      
        <p>That's fucking...</p>
      
        <p>That's really fucking sick.</p>
      
        <p>Like, you know, Japanese people think about fucking our moms or whatever.</p>
      
        <p>Or, you know, Mexicans work hard, but they think of two women.</p>
      
        <p>Chinese people always wanna like...</p>
      
        <p>I've seen a couple of porn where they're getting fucked,</p>
      
        <p>and she's still doing calculations.</p>
      
        <p>How much do you have to work?</p>
      
        <p>That's why they're dominating the whole world.</p>
      
        <p>That rocket is not going to the moon, but it's not.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, so...</p>
      
        <p>But yeah, it's...</p>
      
        <p>Honestly, I'm not...</p>
      
        <p>Somebody asked me what's my fantasy, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like you were saying.</p>
      
        <p>One of my fantasies is...</p>
      
        <p>Did you know when they killed Bin Laden,</p>
      
        <p>they found two laptops and a regular computer,</p>
      
        <p>and they found a bunch of porn in there.</p>
      
        <p>Here's my fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>I pray to God, one of the porn that he was watching is the movie I made.</p>
      
        <p>My movie is so good, he's jacking off like, you know,</p>
      
        <p>Jihahaha.</p>
      
        <p>As a Navy ship's walking off the stairs,</p>
      
        <p>he's jacking off to my movie,</p>
      
        <p>and we get him killed because of my porn.</p>
      
        <p>That's my fantasy right there.</p>
      
        <p>Two shots for one.</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>But, um...</p>
      
        <p>I wrote the US government, like,</p>
      
        <p>could you give me a list of porn that Bin Laden watched?</p>
      
        <p>They won't give it to you. It's classified.</p>
      
        <p>It's classified.</p>
      
        <p>I've learned...</p>
      
        <p>I have one more question because, like,</p>
      
        <p>a lot of people these days get in trouble when they watch porn at work.</p>
      
        <p>Now, you had to watch porn at work.</p>
      
        <p>What would you get in trouble for?</p>
      
        <p>Okay, so, my workstation when I was working, like, um...</p>
      
        <p>Imagine watching porn for eight to ten hours, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like, I'd get sick of it.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I really used to...</p>
      
        <p>Steve, I used to love watching Pixar movies.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>One time...</p>
      
        <p>Like your kids.</p>
      
        <p>I love Pixar movies.</p>
      
        <p>And a lot of the porn guys like Pixar movies, too.</p>
      
        <p>And a lot of the porn guys like Toy Story because,</p>
      
        <p>obviously, the main character is named Woody.</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
      
        <p>But one time, I'm in San Diego.</p>
      
        <p>We were filming, like, I don't know, like,</p>
      
        <p>Gang bang or something.</p>
      
        <p>So, I was there, like, to help them film that.</p>
      
        <p>And then, then, then, then, weekends,</p>
      
        <p>when you're driving back from San Diego to LA,</p>
      
        <p>the traffic is terrible.</p>
      
        <p>So, I pulled over, like,</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to take six hours to go home.</p>
      
        <p>So, every time I stop driving out of San Diego back to LA,</p>
      
        <p>I go to a movie theater, you know,</p>
      
        <p>watch a movie or something to kill me.</p>
      
        <p>So, I remember one time,</p>
      
        <p>I watched every movie except the movie Ratatouille.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm sitting there, right?</p>
      
        <p>I thought, what a stupid name.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I thought?</p>
      
        <p>I thought it was like a gangster movie.</p>
      
        <p>There's a bunch of rats or something.</p>
      
        <p>Anyway, I'm watching, right?</p>
      
        <p>And, like, this is so stupid.</p>
      
        <p>I'm really embarrassed to say this.</p>
      
        <p>So, that was like 2007.</p>
      
        <p>I'm watching the scene at the end of the movie.</p>
      
        <p>It's the scene where the French cuisine critic</p>
      
        <p>is like a really cynical guy.</p>
      
        <p>He's an asshole in the movie, right?</p>
      
        <p>He had that, he ate this food, right?</p>
      
        <p>It reminded him childhood memory of his dad.</p>
      
        <p>And I'm watching that.</p>
      
        <p>All of a sudden,</p>
      
        <p>I'm not, I'm a little embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>I start crying, dude.</p>
      
        <p>Because my dad died four years prior to that.</p>
      
        <p>So, you know, you're not supposed to think about it.</p>
      
        <p>So, like, I was shocked.</p>
      
        <p>That was a movie of stupid.</p>
      
        <p>So, I'm sitting there.</p>
      
        <p>I'm crying.</p>
      
        <p>And you know what happened?</p>
      
        <p>I didn't even know I was crying</p>
      
        <p>until somebody put a hand,</p>
      
        <p>put your hand,</p>
      
        <p>so, you might put your hand there.</p>
      
        <p>Imagine this is me,</p>
      
        <p>little hand,</p>
      
        <p>like this to me, right?</p>
      
        <p>You know who was doing that?</p>
      
        <p>Ratatouille.</p>
      
        <p>Oh, shit.</p>
      
        <p>I didn't say it was like,</p>
      
        <p>I didn't say it was like a three-finger pong.</p>
      
        <p>You know what,</p>
      
        <p>you know what shocked me?</p>
      
        <p>You know what,</p>
      
        <p>you know what shocked me?</p>
      
        <p>There was a little boy sitting next to me.</p>
      
        <p>And the dad's over here.</p>
      
        <p>He saw me crying.</p>
      
        <p>And he puts his hand over it.</p>
      
        <p>And I was terrified.</p>
      
        <p>Because can you imagine if the lights go on,</p>
      
        <p>a boy has a gang of four.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm talking about?</p>
      
        <p>You've just edited eight hours of a gangbang?</p>
      
        <p>With these hats?</p>
      
        <p>I don't do any,</p>
      
        <p>I'm not a pedophile, right?</p>
      
        <p>So, but that really shocked me.</p>
      
        <p>But you,</p>
      
        <p>you know what,</p>
