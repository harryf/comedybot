    <h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>
    <div class="transcript-text">
      
        <p>You know, it's like you might not like the family you grew up, but you come from.</p>
      
        <p>But you love the family you create.</p>
      
        <p>And they really are my family.</p>
      
        <p>You know, so, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>So every time my people make fun like, oh, this porn girl killed herself.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to jack up to it.</p>
      
        <p>I would say anything because I think everybody have a right to do whatever.</p>
      
        <p>But it really hits home whenever a comedian or porn people die.</p>
      
        <p>Because I definitely have a connection with them, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know if I answered your question.</p>
      
        <p>We have one question over here.</p>
      
        <p>I really appreciate what you just said.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>And just from a professional point of view, I'm really curious.</p>
      
        <p>Where do you kind of spot?</p>
      
        <p>For example, for the chapters you said you are making chapters in.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>How do you sense that this is a point where you say, oh, OK, where people like to go?</p>
      
        <p>And it's is it a chapter for men or female?</p>
      
        <p>Well, so we.</p>
      
        <p>You know, so if I put it in the context, so it's like, how does editing porn work?</p>
      
        <p>Is it male?</p>
      
        <p>Like, are you designing the edit for the man or woman?</p>
      
        <p>OK, I apologize.</p>
      
        <p>I kind of misled you.</p>
      
        <p>There's editors who watch the whole movie and edit the movie, right?</p>
      
        <p>I'm not a DVD producer.</p>
      
        <p>My job.</p>
      
        <p>I got to I got to I got to put my pervert cap on and think a guy's watching it.</p>
      
        <p>Where when he's want to masturbate.</p>
      
        <p>What part you want to do?</p>
      
        <p>Because if he's ready to come, you want to jump into the scene that you want to see before.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
      
        <p>So so I got to sit down and do that.</p>
      
        <p>I think I think part of the thing that helped me when you work at the porn shop, you meet you meet a lot of customers.</p>
      
        <p>And whether you like it or not, they'll tell you all the likes and dislikes.</p>
      
        <p>So I put that in my mind and I'll sit down like, well, where would I want to masturbate to?</p>
      
        <p>I want to masturbate to different scenes, you know.</p>
      
        <p>And sometimes if I put a point that was bad, my boss, what if I put a point there?</p>
      
        <p>You know, like so over a period of time, you get better at it.</p>
      
        <p>But this has nothing to do with what you ask.</p>
      
        <p>But part of the reason I start seeing things differently from most conservative porn.</p>
      
        <p>Let's be frank.</p>
      
        <p>Most men watching porn.</p>
      
        <p>They don't watch beginning of porn.</p>
      
        <p>What's the whole thing?</p>
      
        <p>Right.</p>
      
        <p>They take the sexy whatever.</p>
      
        <p>But I have to sit down, watch the whole thing, you know.</p>
      
        <p>So what happens?</p>
      
        <p>I think when you end up watching it, you know, it's just kind of strange thing.</p>
      
        <p>But the way people have said tells me a little bit about their personality.</p>
      
        <p>Like you for Latin America.</p>
      
        <p>I know ladies like when a man could dance really well because I think sometimes women think the way they dance.</p>
      
        <p>That's where they could fuck like smoothly.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
      
        <p>It's all about the hips.</p>
      
        <p>He's half Swiss.</p>
      
        <p>Like just bring it down.</p>
      
        <p>Bring it down.</p>
      
        <p>Half dancing, half spreadsheet with funny.</p>
      
        <p>That's so true.</p>
      
        <p>Because they want to know if you're able to simulate this movement that it's pleasing to ladies, you know.</p>
      
        <p>I just have one thing.</p>
      
        <p>I just have one tag on this one where you said before when you had multiple people watching the same scene going, the shit going in and out.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>During your stand up set.</p>
      
        <p>So when you decided which is the point that people would want to, did that go back to the brain trust as well or was this just you deciding?</p>
      
        <p>Oh, also could you train chat GPT?</p>
      
        <p>What I'm doing is not a technical skill.</p>
      
        <p>It's, I don't want to say it's art, but it's.</p>
      
        <p>Wait, are you like one of the scouts at Money Bowl?</p>
      
        <p>At Money Bowl that says like you cannot do porn by statistics.</p>
      
        <p>Yeah.</p>
