        <p>This kid's hand over.</p>
      
        <p>And that's the amazing thing about kids.</p>
      
        <p>They see good in everyone.</p>
      
        <p>And anybody who were porn,</p>
      
        <p>everybody's a scumbag.</p>
      
        <p>I forgot to tell you</p>
      
        <p>during the story.</p>
      
        <p>Because one time my friend Brandon Iron,</p>
      
        <p>a porn star from Canada,</p>
      
        <p>he called me,</p>
      
        <p>Hey Yoshi, could you help me with something?</p>
      
        <p>I thought he needs a camera guy.</p>
      
        <p>So this one, he's gonna fuck this girl.</p>
      
        <p>And afterward there's like 15 to 20 guys</p>
      
        <p>blow-bang.</p>
      
        <p>Blow-bang is where 20 guys put their dick</p>
      
        <p>and just come on her face.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of similar to Bukkake,</p>
      
        <p>which is Japanese word.</p>
      
        <p>So I said, well if you don't need a camera man,</p>
      
        <p>what do you need?</p>
      
        <p>So here's the scenario.</p>
      
        <p>Brandon's gonna babysit a flake on him.</p>
      
        <p>So they need me babysitting</p>
      
        <p>those two girls, 5 and 7.</p>
      
        <p>I said, Brandon,</p>
      
        <p>I don't feel countable.</p>
      
        <p>Even if they don't shoot,</p>
      
        <p>he had to pay all these people.</p>
      
        <p>It's like $5,000 to go down the toilet.</p>
      
        <p>He can find anybody.</p>
      
        <p>So I show up, take the two kids to McDonald's.</p>
      
        <p>You know,</p>
      
        <p>they're white kids.</p>
      
        <p>What am I doing with white kids?</p>
      
        <p>I'm just like, oh my god,</p>
      
        <p>please don't ask me questions.</p>
      
        <p>And then,</p>
      
        <p>Mommy's at work.</p>
      
        <p>I get the food.</p>
      
        <p>And all this daughter, Sluffy,</p>
      
        <p>she's drinking vanilla milkshake.</p>
      
        <p>She had a vanilla milkshake all over her face.</p>
      
        <p>Which is ironic,</p>
      
        <p>the same thing is happening to mom.</p>
      
        <p>As we speak.</p>
      
        <p>I had to reconcile.</p>
      
        <p>Oh no.</p>
      
        <p>See, if you go to Japanese people,</p>
      
        <p>bukkake, they don't think sex.</p>
      
        <p>That's not something that most foreigners think.</p>
      
        <p>But for those of you,</p>
      
        <p>if you don't know what,</p>
      
        <p>bukkake is a type of noodle.</p>
      
        <p>And they give you a little bit of sauce.</p>
      
        <p>So it's just enough to spread across their face.</p>
      
        <p>That's why when you do bukkake,</p>
      
        <p>all the guys are ejaculating</p>
      
        <p>on the girl's face.</p>
      
        <p>That's why it's called bukkake film.</p>
      
        <p>But bukkake,</p>
      
        <p>95% of Japanese people say,</p>
      
        <p>it's a type of noodle.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of funny,</p>
      
        <p>because two people just walked in,</p>
      
        <p>and I'm talking about a fucking game.</p>
      
        <p>Sorry.</p>
      
        <p>This is actually the moment where we're going to wrap it up.</p>
      
        <p>I have time for one more question.</p>
      
        <p>Anyone?</p>
      
        <p>Was this show weird?</p>
      
        <p>Did I waste your time?</p>
      
        <p>Is there something that you want to hear more or less of?</p>
      
        <p>Because I always want you guys to think.</p>
      
        <p>I have one question.</p>
      
        <p>Yes.</p>
      
        <p>How much confidence,</p>
      
        <p>or should I say,</p>
      
        <p>how did you get into the position</p>
      
        <p>to talk in front of people</p>
      
        <p>when everybody's watching you?</p>
      
        <p>Especially in case of humor,</p>
      
        <p>which is quite individual.</p>
      
        <p>This is actually a very good question.</p>
      
        <p>I told them beginning of the show</p>
      
        <p>something happened with my mom</p>
      
        <p>was basically,</p>
      
        <p>I don't know,</p>
      
        <p>I was in a relationship with my mom.</p>
      
        <p>My mother was forced to marry my dad.</p>
      
        <p>And I had a very typical relationship.</p>
      
        <p>And I hate to say it,</p>
      
        <p>but I overheard my mom talking to her friend one time, drunk.</p>
      
        <p>Because I sneak met her on the downstairs.</p>
      
        <p>You know what she said to her friend?</p>
      
        <p>I should be laughing, but</p>
      
        <p>she said one time,</p>
      
        <p>every time she sees my face,</p>
      
        <p>she wants to kill herself.</p>
      
        <p>Aww, you're beautiful.</p>
      
        <p>So...</p>
      
        <p>It's fine.</p>
      
        <p>It's kind of funny now,</p>
      
        <p>but at the time I didn't really take it that way.</p>
      
        <p>But I think...</p>
      
        <p>But anyway,</p>
      
        <p>I think when you're a comedian,</p>
      
        <p>I think you probably grow up</p>
      
        <p>in a very secure situation.</p>
      
        <p>And maybe</p>
      
        <p>we didn't grow up with people with good listening skills.</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>to have anybody listen,</p>
      
        <p>it really is a privilege, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So, I tried to give...</p>
      
        <p>I tried to be a</p>
      
        <p>as authentic as I can,</p>
      
        <p>and try to tell them</p>
      
        <p>hopefully a meaningful story to make a connection with people.</p>
      
        <p>But sometimes,</p>
      
        <p>it's hard because</p>
      
        <p>in 2019,</p>
      
        <p>my friend Brody, comedian guy,</p>
      
        <p>he killed himself hanging.</p>
      
        <p>My friend Brandon Iron, porn guy,</p>
      
        <p>killed himself hanging.</p>
      
        <p>And my dad killed himself by hanging.</p>
      
        <p>So, it was really, really hard</p>
      
        <p>to process the whole thing, you know?</p>
      
        <p>And I think a lot of times we use comedy</p>
      
        <p>to kind of talk very painfully.</p>
      
        <p>And I was not in a good place.</p>
      
        <p>Plus, 2019, I also turned 50.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think a lot of weird shit was happening.</p>
      
        <p>Thank God COVID hit.</p>
      
        <p>Because I think...</p>
      
        <p>I was able to stay one place for four months.</p>
      
        <p>Kind of process it.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think last four years since COVID,</p>
      
        <p>I changed my act a little bit.</p>
      
        <p>Like, I did French Fist last year.</p>
      
        <p>You know what the most difficult part for me</p>
      
        <p>as a comic?</p>
      
        <p>I think it's true.</p>
      
        <p>We wanted to...</p>
      
        <p>Look,</p>
      
        <p>in Japan,</p>
      
        <p>if you tell a funny joke</p>
      
        <p>and people don't laugh,</p>
      
        <p>we have to cure ourselves.</p>
      
        <p>So, um...</p>
      
        <p>So,</p>
      
        <p>when I tell stories,</p>
      
        <p>you want to tell funny stories</p>
      
        <p>and people get laugh,</p>
      
        <p>it's so difficult</p>
      
        <p>to tell a story as a comedian</p>
      
        <p>not to get laughed.</p>
      
        <p>That's the hard part.</p>
      
        <p>And sometimes when you tell these kind of personal stories,</p>
      
        <p>I think people can't hear it</p>
      
        <p>and they don't want to hear it.</p>
      
        <p>So, I think it's a good place</p>
      
        <p>for people to trust you.</p>
      
        <p>But believe me, it's not easy.</p>
      
        <p>This is more difficult than...</p>
      
        <p>Like, for Japanese,</p>
      
        <p>Bukkake film is more comfortable</p>
      
        <p>than saying,</p>
      
        <p>I love you</p>
      
        <p>and give somebody a hug.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>Emotionally.</p>
      
        <p>It's so difficult.</p>
      
        <p>It's easy for Worshiner,</p>
      
        <p>but it's still lingering</p>
      
        <p>after 50 years.</p>
      
        <p>It's a little bit uncomfortable.</p>
      
        <p>And you know, we're both from Japan.</p>
      
        <p>The reason why we don't want to do it</p>
      
        <p>is not because we're dishonest.</p>
      
        <p>We feel like we're making our problem yours</p>
      
        <p>and it's really shameful</p>
      
        <p>and embarrassing.</p>
      
        <p>And that's something I have to overcome.</p>
      
        <p>So, on top of public speaking,</p>
      
        <p>which is scary too,</p>
      
        <p>I'm struggling with it.</p>
      
        <p>But sometimes after the show,</p>
      
        <p>when people say they really enjoyed it,</p>
      
        <p>and you're not a therapist,</p>
      
        <p>so they have somebody talk to you,</p>
      
        <p>that does give me a little bit of pleasure.</p>
      
        <p>I feel like,</p>
      
        <p>at least one out of 200</p>
      
        <p>did something good.</p>
      
        <p>It did something good.</p>
      
        <p>That was a fantastic question.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very, very much.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, no.</p>
      
        <p>I thought for a second you were going to ask me sarcastic.</p>
      
        <p>That's actually a really good question.</p>
      
        <p>Guys, this has been the show.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you.</p>
