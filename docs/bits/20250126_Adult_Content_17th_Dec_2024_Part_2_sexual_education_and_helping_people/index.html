        <p>I also like, I honestly, sometimes when people feel embarrassed, I tell them I'm a pervert.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a pervert, whatever.</p>
      
        <p>And people are afraid to ask this question.</p>
      
        <p>I had a client at the taboo.</p>
      
        <p>She was she's a Holocaust survivor.</p>
      
        <p>Her husband passed away.</p>
      
        <p>She never grew up in an environment.</p>
      
        <p>You could use that kind of language to say, I want you to touch me this way and that they never had that.</p>
      
        <p>And I think in my I know sounds like a really goofy thing to say, but I think happy sex and orgasm is a human right.</p>
      
        <p>I think it's a part of happiness, you know.</p>
      
        <p>But it wasn't that her husband was bad.</p>
      
        <p>She just they grew up in generation.</p>
      
        <p>You just never talk about these things.</p>
      
        <p>Right.</p>
      
        <p>Like even for most of the people here, especially younger.</p>
      
        <p>What does our parents will say?</p>
      
        <p>No kids, no kids, no kids for years.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a grandkid.</p>
      
        <p>What the fuck?</p>
      
        <p>Like you said, that's a huge leap, isn't it?</p>
      
        <p>So you need people like me because sometimes my friends, kids, people like sometimes my kids, when they were younger, email me.</p>
      
        <p>I heard you work with porn.</p>
      
        <p>I have a question.</p>
      
        <p>I don't know.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not afraid talking about it.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not.</p>
      
        <p>I don't I don't I don't know how to do women orgasm.</p>
      
        <p>And that's a problem.</p>
      
        <p>But I'm not afraid to talk to kids, but I'll still my friends kids like I don't mind talking to you, but I don't feel good about behind their back talking to you.</p>
      
        <p>So you should talk to your parents.</p>
      
        <p>And if you're afraid you get permission from your parents, you could talk to me because I don't want to.</p>
      
        <p>You know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to be a adult.</p>
      
        <p>I don't want to make anybody embarrassed.</p>
      
        <p>You know, that's why I make the most ridiculous person because a lot of people say, well, why would this person judge me?</p>
      
        <p>He's a scumbag at a porn shop.</p>
      
        <p>So you should talk to me.</p>
      
        <p>To help people was what really what really was fun.</p>
