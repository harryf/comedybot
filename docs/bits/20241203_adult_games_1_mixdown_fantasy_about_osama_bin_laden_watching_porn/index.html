        <p>porn.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not gonna work in Canada.</p>
      
        <p>Of course I've worked at working with a visa.</p>
      
        <p>Can you imagine?</p>
      
        <p>Like, I know I'm innocent, but last NAD is like people in California.</p>
      
        <p>Did you hear Yoshi in Toronto or wherever that they thought he had child porn?</p>
      
        <p>Fuck it.</p>
      
        <p>Fuck.</p>
      
        <p>My life is over, right?</p>
      
        <p>Like I'd rather run over child with a car cause I'm an Asian driver.</p>
      
        <p>I'll get away with that shit.</p>
      
        <p>But child porn, that's fucking end of me.</p>
      
        <p>So like, yeah.</p>
      
        <p>So it's, it's really scary when shit like that happens.</p>
      
        <p>You guys are still okay or should I stop or keep going?</p>
      
        <p>No, please.</p>
      
        <p>No, no, please.</p>
      
        <p>Great.</p>
      
        <p>We'll keep going.</p>
      
        <p>Okay.</p>
      
        <p>Somebody asked me, now that, like I watch so much porn because of work, I don't like</p>
      
        <p>watching porn unless I get paid to do it, you know?</p>
      
        <p>And my job is completely reversed for most of you if you work in the office cause I watch</p>
      
        <p>so much porn, sometimes I gotta look around, look around the church cause I have a like</p>
      
        <p>a wall.</p>
      
        <p>I gotta make sure nobody come in.</p>
      
        <p>I always sneak and try to watch Pixar movies.</p>
      
        <p>And if you get caught watching like animated porn, you're gonna get fired cause you're</p>
      
        <p>not supposed to be watching that shit, you know?</p>
      
        <p>Because I get so sick and tired cause I was watching so much porn.</p>
      
        <p>If you show me porn from 2012 and earlier, if you show me a guy from waist down, I could</p>
      
        <p>tell whose dick that belongs to.</p>
      
        <p>That's the, you know what I mean?</p>
      
        <p>That's, that's a lot of fucking porn.</p>
      
        <p>And vagina is like two different things.</p>
      
        <p>It's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know,</p>
      
        <p>it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know,</p>
      
        <p>it's physical and it's just as much as God will be able to tell it according to Unique</p>
      
        <p>�� Poder , Army of the Ummino</p>
      
        <p>If you guys are watching this, cheers.</p>
      
        <p>Poop all over the world.</p>
      
        <p>Three times a day I'm standing here.</p>
      
        <p>I'm not a pussy.</p>
      
        <p>I'm a ass drinker.</p>
      
        <p>I get it.</p>
      
        <p>they all shape differently.</p>
      
        <p>Some dicks like a bit more or they got a triangle dick</p>
      
        <p>or whatever, you know?</p>
      
        <p>So, that went nowhere.</p>
      
        <p>But somebody asked me, Yoshi, now that you watch so much</p>
      
        <p>porn or do you have fantasy?</p>
      
        <p>That's an interesting question because you get bombarded</p>
      
        <p>and I think my fantasy when I was working,</p>
      
        <p>well these days my fantasy is like, you know,</p>
      
        <p>girls showing up on time, not being rude,</p>
      
        <p>stop nagging, you know, but I'm okay being alone,</p>
      
        <p>but when I was working porn, this was my fantasy.</p>
      
        <p>Did you know when the US government aborted by Pakistan,</p>
      
        <p>they killed their mom?</p>
      
        <p>They found him with a bunch of porn, did you know that?</p>
      
        <p>He had a bunch of porn, yeah, he had three wives</p>
      
        <p>and some people believe that Al-Qaeda</p>
      
        <p>would put secret message in porn to send messages</p>
      
        <p>and things like that, but the guy who shot Bin Laden</p>
      
        <p>in Abarabad, after they shot him and took his body,</p>
      
        <p>they went through the room, they found a bunch of DVD porn</p>
      
        <p>and VHS and they found three computers, two hard drives</p>
      
        <p>and a laptop and they found pornography there.</p>
      
        <p>So here's my fantasy because I wrote to the US government,</p>
      
        <p>never got an answer from them.</p>
      
        <p>My fantasy is I prayed to God one of the porn</p>
      
        <p>that he was watching, it's the movie I made.</p>
      
        <p>And my movie is so good, when the Navy SEALs walking up</p>
      
        <p>to zero, he's watching my porn going,</p>
      
        <p>gee ha ha ha ha and then they shoot the motherfucker</p>
      
        <p>in the face, that's my fantasy right there, right?</p>
      
        <p>Oh wait, is that live, the picture, or get off?</p>
