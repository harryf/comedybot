    "text": "And here comes the fucking hotel. And notice, I've been working for, look, the execs are, for many years now, nine to three years, and I've announced that my phone number is not still running. This old man is committing a crime. This is my next down the road. He was. He said, I want 200. Fuck you, I'll give you 10. All right, same thing. Can I say something? Crack dealers are no tender Kissinger. They're not very, they don't know how to negotiate. So these are the kind of shit I had to deal with. So after five years of working there, I just learned so much about human nature and dealing with the customer. I decided to move, I wasn't getting along with my, like I was telling her, I haven't spoken to my mom in over 20 years, I said, I just wasn't getting along. Remember, I have to walk with my pants down. So 2003, I moved from Seattle, Washington to Los Angeles. I ended up working for a company called Evil Angel, one of the biggest gonzo company. And for those of you, traditionally what they used to make is feature film. Feature film means there's actually script, dialogue. The reason why they did it is because trying to protect them. And so from government, because anything with little bit of intellectual creativity, you're protecting them for the first amendment. You know, that's why they make movie called Schindler's Fest. You know, you get the idea. Well, by late 80s, there was a case against all the pornographers in LA, where LAPD went after a pornographer in late 80s in LA, and the pornographers, actually won. So what happened was all the perverts from like, you know, in California and in New York, they moved to LA, hence creating in San Fernando, Porn Valley, because now there's a lot of warehouses, a lot of space north of Hollywood, and they're protected under the law. Customers . You look like one of the porn guy I remember. I'm not kidding. There's a guy named Scott Lyon, he did a lot of porn by the way. I don't know if that's a customer. Oh, you know what that reminds me of? I did a show with my friend Jason, around Oslo, Norway, I think two, we did a show maybe seven to 10 days after the big terrorist attack. Remember about 10th of November in Oslo. Long life, yes. Yeah, so we were doing a show, and, and you know who was in the audience? Jasmine St. Clair, does anybody recognize that name? She did like 500 gangbang, like 20 years ago. I recognize, well, I recognize her right away. Not because I saw her face, I saw her ankle. Because I remember body parts better. So I saw her, right? So it's just really weird, because you know, my mind works a little, my mind works really weird because on one hand, I'm, I'm, I'm reconciled to the fact that 10 days ago, all these people got fucking killed and bombed, and all their body parts are all over the Oslo. And I see Jasmine St. Clair where her body's all over the place because she's fucking 500 men, right? So I have, I, oh. Are you okay? Yes. Oh, okay, good. You should have done it on the book. I think this is really shit. I'm pretty good. Oh, no, no, I just wanted to, hey, did I make you sick? Okay, okay, I'm good. I'm sorry, no, no. I haven't even got the gross part yet. This is how, this is how psychotic I am, right? This is how crazy I am. Because in college, I studied accounting and economics, and I remember going to one of the gang bang, it was making me so angry. You know why? Because I was one of those crazy person in a corner counting exactly how many guys she was fucking. And the number is, they're lying. Those numbers are real. And sometimes they're used to saying that three times. That's not 500 guys. It was like 261. You know what I mean? That's me sleep, so like, that's the kind of shit makes me mad, like lying about. I was literally counting. Okay. Yeah, you were really\u5609? Just watching. I was. You guys are still okay or should I, I stayed yeah, okay. So I, so I end up working for a guy named John Spielano aka Buttman. Can I leave you something? I'm a lot older than you guys. Curious advice but. If you end up working for a guy named Buttman. Iee. made some bad decisions in your life, right? And he owns a company called Evil Angel. The reason it's called Evil Angel is because John used to be a male Chippendale dancer. There was another guy named John, and his routine was dressed like a vampire. That's why they call him Evil John. And at the time, he was dating a girl named Angel. So hence, the company Evil Angel. So anytime anybody asks my mom or somebody's family members, what did your son do? Because I work for a company called Evil Angel EA. My family tells them that I work for a company called EA. Of course, everyone who plays video games knows our name. I'm not ashamed of working in porno, but they really are embarrassed by it. So, you know, five, six years retail, nine years. Evil Angel is one of the biggest porn companies. And to give you an idea, one of our premier directors was Robert Cifredi, and I'm sure some of you recognize him. He's one of the biggest porn stars in Europe. Nacho Vidal and people like that. So what did I do? I did PR for Evil Angel Public Relations. I'll give a little more detail later on. But my job was mostly I was a DVD producer. And basically, my job is watch porno, design the DVD, make it easy for people to masturbate. So I put chapter points. Not based on the story points like Hollywood. I put it, I put points where this is a... This is your job. I love your job. You know what I'm talking about, sir. The point I pick is like, OK, this is the point you should start masturbating because by the time it starts, yeah, you're ready to go. So that's my job. So like, I had to put the pervert cat and just sit there, you know. So, so this, you know, that was my job. And believe me, sometimes. So, you know, I had to make sure. I know this is funny. University was full list. I know this is kind of funny thing to say, but I have to make sure all the names are spelled correctly. I had to make a cast list, like scene one. I had to make sure everybody in the right scene, democracy behind the scene, bonus scene, H2L. I even have to put music for that movie. And I got to put trailers and all kinds of stuff like that. And believe me, I, you know, I'm clicking to 61, you know, gang bang. You know, I'm taking this job really seriously. So one time there was a scene where two girl, two guy and a girl, they were having sex and it was like, oh, I'm going to do this. It's like, oh, I'm going to do this. It's an anal scene. And he put too much lube. So he was going in for a long time. And one time he, when he pulled his dick out, all this liquid just flew out. And the color is very ambiguous. Right? The reason why it's concerned, because if people think it's shit, the police could invade the local porn shop and arrest them and lock the shop up. So they're very, very serious because you know, you can put almost anything online except, you know, like obviously underage. So, you know, I'm not talking about underage stuff or anything to do with animals. And, you know, when I say animal, I'm not talking about Puerto Ricans. But anyway. So anyway. So if the authority thinks that shit, if the authority thinks shit, we could get in trouble. So I have to sit down and, you know, use my equipment. And I got like going backward. So I have to go. In, in, back in the ass, out of the ass. Into the ass, out of the ass. And I just can't make a decision. So what do I do? I blame my colleague. If as though this is like Supreme Court decision, right? So like, so there's like eight of us. We all have to sit down. You know, four people say shit, four people say nay. Well, this is a dead knock, right? So I have to bring the nine person, the general manager, like, like Supreme Court keeps justice, right? So he have to look at it and like, that's fine. Just leave it in there. So, so, you know, because if I don't ask and release it and we get in trouble, we have to bring everything back. I'm going to cost the company a lot of money. So, you know, this is like some fucking serious matters, you know. Another time my boss say, this is during 2007 and 8, and that was a very critical time because, because, you know, several things. It was during the financial crisis too. iPhone was invented. Pornhub was created. So all of a sudden, not only did people are watching convenience at home on the cell phone, but they were able to watch a bunch of free stuff. And it's a big concern for porn business. It got really, really bad from 2007 and 8 on. So my boss at the time said, well, we obviously need to make new movies to bring the new customer back, right? Bring new customer. You know, my boss's idea was we should start making fisting movies. Now, you can put anything online, but as soon as you put in physical things like DVD and VHS, once again, it's covered by local jurisdiction, right? So this is the law in 2007. Fisting is legal as long as you don't put a thumb in there. That's the law. I don't know why. But you know what that tells me? There was a group of lawmakers sitting in the office. I have a discussion, like, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? Like, is this Hammurabi's code from a Sumerian, or is this a biblical version? Or, you know, is it from old? I have no idea, but there's a bunch of guys sit down and say, this is the law. You can't put a thumb in there. So when my boss told me about that, I asked him, like, well, Chris, what happens if a person's missing a thumb? Laws specifically said as long as you don't put a thumb in there, it's legal. And obviously, someone missing a thumb couldn't possibly put a thumb in there. In this particular situation, it's okay. In porn business, this is known as rule of thumb. And so, you know, you're learning stuff. So, you know, I could go, but I'll do a couple other facets of what I had to deal with, like, the last 10 years or so. So, like, that was kind of my job. And when my favorite comedian friend used to start getting Jay Leno, tonight's with Jay Leno. I used to go with him. And then when one of the producers found out I'd written Porn Shop and I did stand-up, they said, like, hey, you know, anytime if we need any sort of porn reference, we'll contact you. Well, you know what happened after that, for the next almost nine years, anytime any porn star, I mean, not porn, anytime you're talking to any Hollywood star and they mention they like porn, I'll bring him a box of porn. For example, Seth Rollins loves porn. I used to bring him a box of porn for him. And his girlfriend who became his wife, they were big fans. So they brought it in. Another time, I brought porn for Jonah Hill. But, you know, the second time we were about it, he said, no, no, no, my girlfriend's here. Just take it away. You know, so like, I had to deal with that kind of shit, you know. So I meet a lot of interesting people in Hollywood. And you know what was interesting about this? When you make work out of fantasy, there's no longer going to be fantasy. Because a lot of my friends say, it must be fun working porn plus seeing naked stuff all the time. I'm telling you, anytime, I'm sure like if I like amateur, like a bartender, that might be fun. But as soon as you make a job out of it, I'm sure it's fun sometimes. But I'm sure sometimes it's like fucking shit, right? People are like scumbags and they don't tip well. You know, you don't have to say it. But when you make work out of fantasy, it's no longer fantasy. This is a big, interesting. A lesson because every time I went to try show, guys who are actors wish they're athletes or singers. So it's never enough even if you reach the peak of fantasy. And this is the thing.",
