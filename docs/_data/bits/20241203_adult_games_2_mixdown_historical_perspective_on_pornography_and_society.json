    "text": "I don't know if that makes sense. No, it does. Oh, yeah. Definitely does. So, it's an art thing. Eventually, it kind of... We have another question over here. This is so serious. I don't even think it's... It's weird. Sorry. I don't know what I'm... I was wondering if you could comment on like, what do you think, like, how big is the percentage of female porn? Yeah. Female porn workers who are actually in the business out of passion because they actually love it. And how big is the percentage of women who are kind of like, forced kind of like into the situation out of financial reasons or other things? Yeah. I think that's a very good question. And my friend Peter Warren, he's an editor for ABN, Adobe Video News. It's a big magazine that covered adult business. And they're competitive as ex-biz. And ABN also sponsored the big porn show, abortion porn show. And I think this is the first of five of them that has eachinding to\uacf3. And literally, that person seemingly not... If I can just ask him one question, with context here, what is ABN doing to spices up their sexy isfy, eye piercing, abdominal, questioned. That's another thing that Peter just did. Yeah. Father Sir\u90fd\u6709 uma... Just now I was asking to my friend, Peter Warren, that's an interesting question, and you'll probably get the wrong idea, but yeah, a lot of us want to know what this idea is. I have my own personal opinion. And that's really honest and single and crystal clear. And just for, you know, some winner if you want to Jeff honey that it and. You know, you're not. They don't want to share things because they're not Carolina, they don't even think about that for the time being. And I think early 2000 when I saw a lot of European stars, especially from Eastern Europe, I think they were a little different. I think they come from poor country and a lot of them were saying, look, we cannot make this kind of money where I'm from. And I could make so much money to the point where it's a generational wealth. So they were telling me, look, maybe they don't like me, but the kind of money that I bring, my family will never have to worry. And the smart ones, they go back to like, I don't know, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary, that they spend the money on a hotel and buy business. They're okay. Of course, there's many cases where they give their money to their suitcase pen for slash husband and they take the money. It's a tough one. I mean, I wish I could say that they did it because they're sexually liberated and they want to do, but I think the situation is a lot more complicated. It's a tough question. What were your limits in this industry? Was there a point where certain people you were like, I'm not going to work with that person? I'm behind the scene. Yeah, but if people you would have an issue with. Right now, so I produce and consult on a document for a pandemic. I think we released it like five years ago. There was an HIV outbreak in 1997. And we tried to figure out how that happened. And here's a weird thing about documentary, you know, like, I thought it happened for a letter A reason. After we did research and interview everyone. I was wrong. It was a reason B. You know, what was I giving you the documentary that was based on? What was your question? My question was there any one of you like this person is an asshole? Oh, okay. I'm working on a second documentary. A guy, his stage name is Confusion, which in English means like, you know, turn your arm or what is it the kind of like a body injury? This. Yeah, but he spelled it K-H-A-N like Genghis Khan space Tujun. And what he does in the movies, you never see him. He, if you're a new porn girl and you're strong, like you could say all kinds of terrible things to her. It doesn't impact her. That's fine. Like, Annette Schwartz, she's a German porn star. You could not say anything to her to unface her. She's very strong. A guy like Confusion in porn business, there is a small percentage of these guys, they really want her women. And what he does is he verbally finds some, like, we all have a sensitive part, right?",
