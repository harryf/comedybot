    "text": "You know, it's like you might not like the family you grew up, but you come from. But you love the family you create. And they really are my family. You know, so, yeah. So every time my people make fun like, oh, this porn girl killed herself. I'm going to jack up to it. I would say anything because I think everybody have a right to do whatever. But it really hits home whenever a comedian or porn people die. Because I definitely have a connection with them, you know. I don't know if I answered your question. We have one question over here. I really appreciate what you just said. Yeah. And just from a professional point of view, I'm really curious. Where do you kind of spot? For example, for the chapters you said you are making chapters in. Yeah. How do you sense that this is a point where you say, oh, OK, where people like to go? And it's is it a chapter for men or female? Well, so we. You know, so if I put it in the context, so it's like, how does editing porn work? Is it male? Like, are you designing the edit for the man or woman? OK, I apologize. I kind of misled you. There's editors who watch the whole movie and edit the movie, right? I'm not a DVD producer. My job. I got to I got to I got to put my pervert cap on and think a guy's watching it. Where when he's want to masturbate. What part you want to do? Because if he's ready to come, you want to jump into the scene that you want to see before. Yeah. So so I got to sit down and do that. I think I think part of the thing that helped me when you work at the porn shop, you meet you meet a lot of customers. And whether you like it or not, they'll tell you all the likes and dislikes. So I put that in my mind and I'll sit down like, well, where would I want to masturbate to? I want to masturbate to different scenes, you know. And sometimes if I put a point that was bad, my boss, what if I put a point there? You know, like so over a period of time, you get better at it. But this has nothing to do with what you ask. But part of the reason I start seeing things differently from most conservative porn. Let's be frank. Most men watching porn. They don't watch beginning of porn. What's the whole thing? Right. They take the sexy whatever. But I have to sit down, watch the whole thing, you know. So what happens? I think when you end up watching it, you know, it's just kind of strange thing. But the way people have said tells me a little bit about their personality. Like you for Latin America. I know ladies like when a man could dance really well because I think sometimes women think the way they dance. That's where they could fuck like smoothly. You know what I'm saying? It's all about the hips. He's half Swiss. Like just bring it down. Bring it down. Half dancing, half spreadsheet with funny. That's so true. Because they want to know if you're able to simulate this movement that it's pleasing to ladies, you know. I just have one thing. I just have one tag on this one where you said before when you had multiple people watching the same scene going, the shit going in and out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. During your stand up set. So when you decided which is the point that people would want to, did that go back to the brain trust as well or was this just you deciding? Oh, also could you train chat GPT? What I'm doing is not a technical skill. It's, I don't want to say it's art, but it's. Wait, are you like one of the scouts at Money Bowl? At Money Bowl that says like you cannot do porn by statistics. Yeah.",
