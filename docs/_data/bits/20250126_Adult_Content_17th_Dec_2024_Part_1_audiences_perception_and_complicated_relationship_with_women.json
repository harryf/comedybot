    "text": "But I would like to address, I did a show here, what was it, two weeks ago? Okay, so we did a show. Response was good. Somebody asked me after the show, Yoshi, do you hate women? Or, because you work in porn business, did you learn to hate women? The answer is no. But I do have a complicated relationship with women. And when I say complicated, I'm talking about my mother. And here's a kind of common experience with my mom. So, I think I was like five or six years old. I'm sure, is English your first language? For most of you? Arabic is my first language. Okay. So, you guys are, this is an incredible global place. So, I'm sure you know about chicken pox, right? Yes. Okay. So, I was five or six, maybe seven, I was six. And my body is completely covered in chicken pox. And I should just stay home. But some reason my mom decided to drag me out of the house. A couple blocks away in this very small aisle with a bunch of stores on both sides. You know, Japan is a very small place. And I don't understand why she's dragging me. I'm really, really sick. And all of a sudden, I see my mom's four friends. And they're saying something. And basically, my mom's explaining to them, I have chicken pox. And you know what she does? They all look at me and my mother pulled my pants down, showed my little cock with chicken pox all over. And they started laughing, right? And Harry, here's the thing. That was the first time a lady started laughing at my little cock. Oh, my God. But believe me, that wasn't the last time. So I'm confused because I'm just a kid in Osaka. Okay, so, you know, I live in a taishoku, which is a ghetto. It really is a ghetto. So they start laughing. About a minute, they turn around and just walk away and just leave me there. So I have my pants down. So I start walking like a penguin just chasing after my mom. Because, you know, I'm not looking with my mom. And, of course, I trip. And it's always been like that. My mother was basically forced to marry my dad. So anytime she has a free time to spend time with her friends, she just completely abandoned me and just leave. So, like, that's pretty indicative when I was a kid, you know, chasing after people that wasn't willing to give me affection. So I don't hate women, but I never really learned to make a connection with women very well.",
