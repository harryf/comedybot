    "text": "because you guys are a wonderful audience. I did, last time I was here, I did 10 shows at the Top Secret Club, and the first nine shows, it went extremely well. I got a little cocky, on the last show, I did American show. I don't wanna take exactly what I said, it was really bad. People got really upset with me. In fact, the guy writing the show wanna punch me in the face. So, I'm a little, you know. I mean, I was not really that worried, because, you know, that's one thing I have to say about England, you know, nobody's got guns. So, that's a really good news for me. So, anyway, I just wanna get it out there. Since you don't know me, I wanna tell you a couple things. This happened about a couple years back. My roommate, Irish-American guy, Rick, he spent his lifetime dream to go to Japan. So, he went to Japan, and the only thing I have to do is make sure nothing happened to our apartment, and especially to his cat, Juanito. So, it was a couple days later, you know, as I'm walking into the apartment, huge explosion. It's like a couple days away from Full Ditch Life, which is American National Holiday, and the goddamn cat ran into the apartment, so I lost the cat. So, I'm panicking, like, what do I do? Like, do I take a chance? Hopefully, I can find a cat within the next 14 days before he get back, or do I ruin his vacation by killing him? I really couldn't make a decision. So, this is what Rick's mom said, Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son's cat, and you don't give him the opportunity to look for the cat, he's gonna resent you. And I thought, you know what? She's really right. So, I emailed him. Because of time difference, he finally called me 14 hours later. Have you ever had a conversation with somebody that's been clearly been crying for a long time? How could you hear an impact of his throat? He goes, Yoshi, well, that wasn't the funny part. Okay, wait a minute. So, he said, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat, but I gotta say something to you. Oh, my God. He's gonna ask him to move out. He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat? He said, no. He's, uh... I'm from Japan. We don't eat our lord and savior Hello Kitty. So, uh... So, anyway, um... So, he begged me, and please, you know, whatever, like, before I come home, please, you know, your best of ability to look for my cat. So, like a crazy person, like midnight, 3 a.m., 6 a.m., 9 noon. Like, every time I come home, I'm like, Every three hours, like a crazy person, I go out in the street, shaking the cat food, saying Juanito, like a crazy person. I have to admit, these kind of things does teach you empathy, because until that point, I never noticed like lost animal sight. All of a sudden, I get it now, you know, and I need to do it. And then one day passed, a week, and it's getting a couple days away from the day Greg came home, and I'm just panicking, you know, it's like, to me, it is like his child. So I was desperate, so I went to my friend Eddie Ip's podcast, and on the podcast, he said, please, you know, if you happen to live in LA, I live in Hollywood in H-Mund, and if you want to volunteer and help me, please contact me, and if you find the cat, that's even better. Okay, this is why I made a mistake, and I think it would work in London, it would not work in the United States. I made a mistake by giving my personal cell phone number. So I think, he told me within 24 hours, I think like 45, 50,000 people downloaded the episode. And, by the way, I live in Los Angeles. So I think within an hour, somebody said, hey, I think I found your cat. So I clicked the picture, and it's a picture of huge cock. And... Yeah. That's the thing. I'm a big fan of the cat. I kind of deserve it. You know what was the weird thing? I think when Rick finally showed up, he drove his motorcycle, and the goddamn cat reappeared.",
