    "text": "you know, sometimes people rent a movie and they're supposed to return next day, and sometimes they forget. So we charge $3.00 LATHE every day. Well, John spent renting for a long time. He doesn't return for one month, two months. Eventually it hit three months, so like, it's almost $100, you know? So eventually I called and left a message. Couple days later, a lady walked in and said, hi, I'm here for John's account. First of all, we'll never tell somebody they have an account or not, especially if it looks like their girlfriend or wife. So I told her, like, I can't tell you whether he has an account or not. And she said, I know he has an account because she left a message, and, like, I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it's a message. And plus, that's my husband. He died a month ago. So that's why he didn't return the tape. So she said, please, I need to know what porn my husband was watching. I usually don't tell them that, but I'm very weak when a lady crying, like, you know, she started crying, like, you know, you know, like, when they're crying, that's a weapon that they use against you. I can't do anything. All right. And I put the monitor, and I shouldn't have done it, because it created more problems, because she looked like 15, 20 years of rentals, and why was my husband watching pissing film? Why was my husband watching Granny Gang Bang? I don't know. He was watching Fossil Fuckers number 14, 15, 16, right? And I cannot, I can't answer that. But ladies, you know what I realized? It took me 22 years to figure this one. This is how dumb I am. I think, I don't know. I don't think she was upset because he was watching porn. You know what I think she was upset? There was a part of his life he was so afraid to share with her, and I think that's why she was upset. And two, here's another mistake I've made. You know what he used to tell me? Yoshi, my wife is the best wife. She's such a wonderful mother, a great chef, great love of my life, and also she just got another promotion at the architectural firm, right? You know what's sad? He never said that to her. It's really sad because he only told that to this pervert. Right? So I think she was upset because she feel like there's part of her husband that she never really got to know. And I think, I also understand where he's coming from because I think he was afraid to show that side because sometimes some people get weirded out or, you know what I mean? It's like you get scared. Oh my God, my husband's a fucking weirdo or something like that. So this is, I think, is a sad thing for both sides, you know? I try to be compassionate to people, you know, because I think so many people are lonely. Now, within a couple of years, I realized, even if you have the money, if you want to open a sex shop, you have to get zoning laws, and they're only limited among each city. It's almost very difficult. It's almost like a mob run the whole city with who have a sex shop. So once I realized that, like, I don't think I could open a sex shop, so I decided, like, maybe I'll move to New York from Seattle. So my aunt said, oh, why don't you work for my business? We're gonna sign a lease for a nail salon in lower Manhattan so you could be a bookkeeper. Okay, great, I could stop working porn. So my aunt signed a lease on September 9th, 2001. She called me September 10, 2001, so you got a job. September 11th, I don't have a fucking job. So what happened, I decided to move from Seattle to LA instead, and a year and a half later, I went to a porn convention at my favorite porn company, Evil Angel, where Rocco Cerveri is one of the director and performer. Nacho Vidal, John Stagliano, it's all Italian. Like, John Stagliano, Joey Severo, John Leslie, this is, like, you know, Italian. And, you know, Rocco is super Italian. So, um... Extra time. Very. You know, and, um, Evil Angel's, like, the new movie, it's like, the new movie. It's like, you know, the new movie, it's like, the new movie, it's like, the new movie, like the New York Yankees of porn, or Manchester United, or, uh, uh, you know, the football team in Milan. Okay. You have to know that. Yes, thank you. Um... So I got a job there, because I was the only one applying job out of the 50,000 people visiting the convention. I got the job. And when I worked for the porn company... So when I worked for PornShop, I was getting a foreign degree in perversity. Now I'm working in a production company. I'm getting my PhD. So I'm working in a production company. I'm getting my PhD. So I'm working in a production company. I'm getting my PhD. So I'm working in a production company. So I learned a lot of amazing things about porn that most regular people don't know. So I learned a lot of amazing things about porn that most regular people don't know. So, um, 2007, we were having crisis in porn, for three reasons. One, iPhone and PornHub, it's destroying porn business. People watching porn, but they're not paying for it. So about 40% of porn business went down the toilet. So we were in panic. And three, we were heading global recession. So those three things were killing our business. So my boss at the time said, we need to make a new product to bring the customer back. You know what my boss's idea was? Let's start making fisting movies, right? You know, right? Now, you can put almost anything online, minus, you know, animal tapes or shitting or underage kids. You can't put that. But fisting online is fine. But as soon as you put it on DVD or VHS, you're gonna get judged by local community standards. So police could come and shut your, your store down. So this is a law in 2007. Fisting is legal as long as you don't put a thumb in there. That's the law in America. I don't know why. You could put four fingers on somebody's mouth, anus, vagina, that's fine. But as soon as you put a thumb in together, it's illegal. So I asked my boss, what happens if a person's missing a thumb, right? So the law said, as long as you don't put a thumb, it's legal, and since somebody missing a thumb, this particular person could put all the way in, and it's legal. In porn business, this is known as rule of thumb. Now, see, you're learning something. I feel sad that he missed that joke. So Robbo used to cause a lot of problem for me, you know? He's a wonderful guy. But he's crazy. He does anything that he wants. So there was a scene when this issue, you know, was, you know, there was a scene when this issue, you know, was, you know, this Eastern European girl was tied to a tree naked, and Robbo shows up. But you know what happened? Robbo's naked, right? He walks in with a donkey. So he tied the donkey to a tree. Then he walk up to the girl. Now, when a girl's tied up, you cannot have sex with her right away. You have to untie the hand, because if you don't, that's an implied rape. So Robbo did that. He took everything off, everything's fine. Okay, here's the problem. Maybe you guys know, but I don't. I don't know. When donkeys see people having sex, they get excited. So donkey's penis got hard and big, right? So when Robbo's having sex with this girl, donkey's getting excited. You know what Robbo makes the cameraman do? He make the cameraman film the couple having sex, but every once in a while, he'll pan the camera to the donkey's dick. That's a problem for me, because I have to edit that shit out. It creates extra five hours of fucking job for me. I don't like that. But Robbo thinks it's funny. Oh, look at the, you know, like, you know, like, you know. You know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know. You know, Robbo, so he does kind of stuff. Another time, Robbo was fucking this girl, doggy style anal, and he put too much lube. So when he put his penis out, all the liquid flew out of the ass, right? Which is, which is fine. Here's the problem. So when I'm using, yeah. When I use the editing bay, the fast forward, the fast forward. So you see the liquid moving out of the ass, out, the liquid, the liquid, the liquid, the liquid, the liquid. Like that. The reason why I'm looking at it, because depends on the frame. Sometime it looks clear, another time it looks green. Another time it looks like brown and orange. Why is that a problem? Because if that's shit, we cannot have that. So I'm sitting there, I'm using my eyes, like, is that shit? Or, you know what I mean? I was 40 years old. I had to sit there on the camera. So I have to, my, I have to sit there, I have to sit there, I have to call my colleague. There's six of us, six men standing in front of the camera, like a referee. And like, so three people say shit, three say names. So we have, we have a deadlock. So I have to call, I have to call a lawyer from downtown. And like, you have to fucking drive all the way from downtown to Van Nuys and make a decision. And of course, like, oh, that's fine. See, these are the kinds of things we, we always have to deal. Now, sometimes when Rocco's filming, he's filming movies and stuff, you know? So one time he was filming a movie where one girl, 40 guys, okay? Gang bang, right? Okay, my job, my job is to make sure, by the way, a lot of my friends think that's exciting. No, no, no. It's not exciting. If you could just smell what that room smells like. You know, it's not good. You have one beautiful girl and like 40 manholes. It's not, it's not fun. So my job is make sure they're 18 years old, right? And after they're done, somebody have to clean that room. I have to clean. So she's standing there, everybody, you know, do their business. Sorry, ladies, but. So I have to mop. Okay, I'm a dumb guy, right? I thought I should have a big boots. Like with the big boots, because I'll be higher. So I'm away from all the liquid, okay? So this is what happened. I'm trying to mop. And because this is such a high boots, I walk and I trip and I drop, I drop right here. Just pull up, come right? I'm just wet here, wet here. I'm wet hair, right? So everybody, she's, everybody's covering their face. Like they don't know what to do, but I'm a funny guy. So you know what I do? I do, I do the snow angel on the ground. I do like a calm angel like this, right? I do that. Of course, it's funny. I don't like it because I have combed all of my hair. My hair looks like this, but you know, you have to have fun. I post rock, everybody laugh, it's funny. So, so living in LA, you know, I think I meet a lot of interesting people over the years. And when I'm doing comedy shows, I meet someone like a show business people. And one year, my favorite was on the Tonight Show. And when I was talking to Tonight Show people, when they find out like, oh, you work in porn business, sometime Hollywood stars said they like porn. So could you come back with box of porn? So next eight years, every time stars say I like porn, I bring box of porn for them. And a couple of times I met some of the presidential candidate, so I saw Obama before he was president. I saw Trump before he was president. Interesting. Because I met so many of those presidential candidates at Tonight Show, I learned something interesting. Porn have a really interesting way to predict who's going to be president of the United States, based on the kind of porn that was popular. So 2000 and 2004 election, the most popular porn is what I call torture porn, where they used to put ladies sat down in the toilet like Rocco, and they flush the toilet like, you know, waterboarding. Or they put ladies in a dog cage like Guantanamo Bay. That's when I knew Bush was going to win in 2000 and 2004, because he used to torture women. He used to torture people. Most popular porn in 2008 and 2012, interracial porn. We knew Brock got this shit, right? So in 2016, most popular porn was incest porn, where they're fucking their stepdaughters and stepson. Trump used to say all the time, you know, if Ivanka wasn't my daughter, I would date her. So we knew Trump's going to win it. And most popular porn in year 2000, senior citizen and dementia porn. So we knew Biden. Biden got that shit, right? So they have a really good job predicting who's going to be the next president. So another time, we had a really interesting, when Mike Tyson was walking around at the porn convention, saying, hey, Mike, you should come to our booth, because we have the best porn star. And he came to Eva Angel booth. Now, and that's Vanity, star at 2004. That's correct spelling. For legal reasons, you have to change. Now. So Mike Tyson, he's a star. So Mike came straight to our booth. So he's looking at Vanity. She's got her arm around Mike. And they kiss. And Mike's just grabbing her ass and tits like that, and got her number, and they're kissing. And this is me, obviously. OK, you notice I'm smiling, but nobody's smiling, and they're kissing? The reason why I'm smiling, because Vanity's got a beautiful eight-inch cock. So Mike doesn't know that. That's why I did it. I thought it was funny. Here's another thing. You notice I'm touching my ears right here? I'm telling Bella Donna, she's a female porn star, to Mike, I'm telling her, bite his ear off. For those of you who follow boxing, he bit Evander Holyfield. So when he heard me say it the second time, Mike gave me this look. Oh my god, I fucking ran out of there. Ran out like the way my dad would. My dad ran out of the public bath. Because Mike Tyson is a man. I'm Yoshi, I'm not a man. You know what I'm saying? So I ran out. Now, the reason I'm telling you, this would have been kind of a funny story, but I made a huge, huge mistake. I learned something about Los Angeles and fantasy business. There was a guy named Dave Hanschmidt. He was a very big figure in Underworld, in adult business. He is a sex tape broker. So he brokered Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian tape. So they make way more money than regular porn. So I made a mistake. I emailed him and said, check out this picture. So I had a picture of Vanity with Mike. And I sent another email where Vanity's fucking regular guy in the ass with her dick. And third email, I say, if you think that's amazing, I have sex tape of Mike and Vanity, which is a lie. I just lied because I thought it was funny. And like, goof, you know? It's not funny. It's funny because next couple of months, he didn't threaten me, but he had ways with words. He basically said, look, I'm going to get that tape, whether you like it or not. And I know where you work. I never told him where I work. He somehow figured out where I work. I think a month and a half later, he just fucking appeared in my production company. I ran out of the back window and hid in a garbage can. And I really didn't know because I heard stories like, he's like a bit of a thug. You know, he has people working for him. Because you've got to remember, if you make it huge in LA, money, fame, and power. So you forget there's people like that. I'm panicking for like six months. I didn't know what to do until my favorite movie star, Tom Cruise, got him killed. OK, not technically. But what happened was, Hans Schmidt said, he claims he had the wedding picture between Tom and Katie Holmes at the time. Then he said, I'm going to get that tape. I'm going to get that tape. And he said, he has sex tape of Tom Cruise. Now, he implied it might be with another man. Well, Tom Cruise is not an idiot. He's not superstar for no reason. He went to FBI, completely honest with everything. Guy, this guy, arrested. Two weeks later, Hans Schmidt killed himself. So when this happened, I said to myself, thank god for Scientology. Fuck that. I'm going to kill this guy. Jesus Christ. My life is saved. I was so scared. You know, fuck this guy, right? Unbelievable. I love Tom Cruise. I learned a hard lesson that you shouldn't fuck with people like that because money and fame is such a powerful thing. People almost do anything. Now, you know, somebody asked me one time, do you still have fantasy? Because I produced like 800 porn movies. That's a really good question. I only have one fantasy left. My fantasy is, did you know when the United States killed Bin Laden, we sent a Navy SEAL there. Not only did they kill Bin Laden, they took two of his laptop and a hard drive. It's full of porn. So I sent a letter to the US government, want to know what porn Bin Laden was watching. I really want to know. The reason I want to know is because my fantasy, I pray to god the porn that he was watching is a movie I made. My fantasy is that I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill him. My porno is so good when he's jacking off, you know, ha ha ha ha. Navy SEALs walking up the stairs and end up shooting him. That's my fantasy right there, right? Well, everything comes to an end. Nothing lasts forever. In 2012, I was fired from Evil Angel. I don't want to get in detail, but there's a very famous podcast called The Last Day of August in 2019. Yeah. August Ames killed herself. I'm in that pod. And she killed herself because she told a bunch of people that, ladies, if you work with men doing gay porno, just be aware there's a higher rate of getting HIV if you do that. I'm not saying don't do it. Just be aware that it's more dangerous. So, I thought she was very fair. Just aware. Well, industry turned against her, shamed her for two weeks, then she killed herself. Very sad. The reason why they interviewed me, because August Ames' husband, he's a very famous person, his husband got me fired from the job. So, if you want to know, you could just listen to The Last Day of August 2019. Thank you for listening. So, I got fired. I got offered to work for other porn companies. But I didn't want to get another job at another porn company because, I'll be honest, there's parts of porn that's a little crazy, and two, I have to say, you know, when I go to Italy, Your country, like in many of Latin American countries, just pro-family. The family is the most important thing. Porn is not necessarily pro-family, you know what I mean? So I thought, I got to the age where, maybe I should just move on. I don't hate porn, but maybe I'd be better off trying to be normal. So I got out of the job, and last 11 and a half years I've been traveling the world. I have not paid rent since February of 2012. I've been traveling. Using my pornographic knowledge and my pornographic vision, I've been traveling the world, trying to make the world a better place. It's what I call perverts without borders. Now when I say pornographic eyes, if you show me porn from 2012 or earlier, and you show me a penis, I could tell you about 95% accuracy whose penis that belongs to. You show me buttholes, like 85, 90% accuracy, both men, women, trans, you know, like that. I'll put that in your resume. Now, in one time I was watching a commercial in America. It's one of those athletic gym membership, right? So they were exercising, and I told my friend, did you see that? And nobody caught it. There's an exercise where the lady's flat in an exercise, lifting her leg. When she lifted her leg, I could see her pussy lip, because she wasn't wearing panties. But it's really small split second. So I have a pretty good eye for catching stuff like that. So I've been traveling around the country, using my knowledge. For those of you who know MAGA, Make America Great Again, they're the Trump people, mostly white people. I went to that rallies. I went to Black Lives Matter rallies too. Now, interesting, when I go to MAGA Trump people, you know what's their favorite kind of porn? Big tits. Kind of makes sense because most of the Trump people are white. White people traditionally come from Northern Europe. Historically, what's the main diet of Northern Europe? Dairy. Where does dairy come from? Big tits. So, I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you where dairy comes from. Big tits, like cows, right? If you see BLM, like black, Latinos, some Asian people, they come from Southern region, so they're ass men. So sometimes when I see these two people arguing, it's like tits, ass, tits, ass. And I'm saying, like Bronco would say, hey guys, you could like both. You should like tits and ass, right? But they're fighting. You know what's interesting? Do you know the group that won these poor whites and poor minorities fight each other? The super rich elite people. They want the poor people to fight each other. And you know what rich people are into? They're not into tits or asses. I went to Kensington, London. I went to Upper East Side, New York. Ginza in Tokyo. I went to the expensive places in Paris, Dubai. Every place I go, whether in Africa, Latin America, rich people always are attracted to women who are tall, no tits and no asses. So, when you see the church, Jeffrey Epstein's victims, they're kids. They have no tits and asses. Something about super rich and elite people, they like that kind of body type. One of my theories, I meet a lot of high tech guys, tech bros, the people who are on Silicon Valley. They're not men. They're boys. You know, their taste is like, they don't see women as a whole thing. They don't see women. They only see body parts. So, the reason why they like those skinny women, because the only thing they care about is three holes. Mouth, pussy and asshole. So, skinnier the person, you get closest to three things that they only care. They don't care about the rest of them. And people like that cause the most problems, you know. I was one of the four people who went to court with the Ghislaine Maxwell's case. So, I was there. I was one of the four civilians watching her get a guilty verdict. And I also went for sentencing. And interesting, during the sentencing, all the victims, these women, they each spoke for the victims, you know, what happened to them. And even though they're 35, 40, maybe 45 years old, when I look at them, I see them as kids, you know. It's a heartbreaker because I've been reading about them for so long. It's terrible what happened to them as kids. One after another, they talk about how they were abused. So, they're finished. Judge Nathan was ready to give a sentence. The defense said, excuse me, Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell would like to speak. Shocking. She never spoke one time during trial, but she wanted to speak at the sentencing. For those of you in English, I finally learned the word posh, upper class, the Cambridge, Oxford level English, the language of speaking to nobility, the Pope and President. Because when Ghislaine Maxwell spoke, I'm not going to lie, I was seduced by her. She sounds like female Darth Vader. The way she speaks to you, like authority, sexiness, power, all of a sudden, I forgot the victims right away. You know what's sad? Next day when I read the transcript, she didn't even apologize. She spoke with authority, but she put all the blame on Jeffrey Epstein. Now, I was 53 years old when I heard her speak, and I was seduced. Do you think 14, 15, 16 year old girls have a chance? They have no chance. These are kids with no father, no opportunity. They live in a really tough neighborhood. Imagine you have little to no opportunity. This beautiful English lady, who is a millionaire, knows all the most powerful people on the planet, trying to give you the whole world. I think that's why I like to travel the world, talk about this stuff, because did you know that most of the kids getting abused, if they know that their parents don't like talking about sex, they will not come and ask for help, because they don't want to upset their parents. So, if you're a parent, and you take that stance, what you're basically doing is, you're endangering your kids, because kids know that they can't come to you. It's very shameful. If you're a parent, you should be open to talk to your kids about anything. That's why every time I do comedy show and talk, I always do dirty jokes, and people always complain, why do you have to talk dirty? Well, how dare you? You're an adult, you can't take a dirty joke. It's people like you, are endangering kids every fucking day. So that's why I like talking about this subject matter. Since you're cool, let me do one last one, and I'll finish. By the way, this is a Ben Laden joke. I was fantasizing, he's Hillary and Obama. Remember when they killed Ben Laden? So I'm right here, I'm so happy. Okay, so I'll finish with this. I was always worried, working at a porn company, especially in porn shops, sometimes customers are going to ask, inappropriate product. Underage kids, obviously. But you know the one that I was really worried? I was worried that sometime, maybe somebody's going to ask for, rape porn. And it did happen. Do you know who asked for rape movies? Every single time? It's women. Now, I'm not saying, all women have rape fantasy. Some women do have rape fantasy. But if you have a rape fantasy, you can't go public and say, hey, I like rape, because you might get attacked. So how do some women, who are into rape fantasy, explore that fantasy? They do it by thinking, reading, and watching stories about vampires. Now, if you think about it, if you read vampire, watch vampire movie, what does this vampire do? They fly in the middle of the night, into women's bedroom. What is the word they use? They ravish her. So next you know it, they're biting her neck, seducing her. But if you take the words, vampire Dracula, that is the action of a rapist. You can't just go into women's bedroom and start raving their clothes. Now, men judge women usually by visual cues. But women tend to like psychological cues. So sometimes you see women with ugly guys, because there's a psychological part that's satisfying. Now, do you know what's the full body part the men Google online for sexual satisfaction? Take a guess. What's the full favorite body part? Feet. Feet? Yes, feet. Oh, feet. Fingers. Lips. Okay, feet, ass. Did you say tits? I said tits. Okay, yes. So feet, ass, and tits. One more. This is a tricky one. Fingers. No, it's penis. Why? Not because men are interested in penis. There are type movies like Little White Chains, The Little White Chains, and The Little White Chains. But they're not just about penis. They're about the penis. And the penis is like Little White Chick, Big Black Monster Dick. They're anticipating women's reactions in Huge Dick. That's why they're Googling. That's why transgender porn is popular because it has feet, ass, tits, and dick. It's called sexual optical illusion. Gay men are not into transgender stuff at all. It's heterosexual men. There's another porn star named Angel, Buck Angel. She looked like a muscular, skinhead looking guy. Big chest. Looked like that. But she has a vagina. And she's a woman. She's a woman. Big chest. Looked like that. But she has a vagina. Heterosexual men are not interested in her. Gay men are interested in her, even though she has a vagina. Because different psychological cues. So next time when you see something like this, it has an underlying theme. Like a woman getting manhandled. Or sea monster is another one that they like. Werewolf is very popular. You know, remember Beauty and the Beast? The women say, I could change him. Women like men in prison because they're a monster. They could go to jail. They could control. This is the part that makes me sad. This lady says she likes getting manhandled. She got fired from her job. Isn't it sad? When the women say she loves something, I think it's women's right to have orgasm. I think it's women's right to have what they want. It shouldn't be always about men's needs. I think it should be 50-50 both ways. Well, she said what she wanted. They fucking fired her. So it's terrible. I got to end the show. So I tell all the women, I tell all the stories because when I was talking to my friend Asa Kira, she's an Asian porn star. One time she did triple anal, right? So she had three dicks in her asshole. So I asked Asa, Asa, how much money did you make? She goes, oh my God, that's personal. Personal? You have three dicks in your asshole, right? But she's right. She's absolutely right. Because money is the number one most taboo subject matter. Then sex is number two. I think that's why Jeffrey Epstein was such a powerful person. Because he could manipulate billionaires with sex. He could manipulate Prince Andrew through money. Because when you feel comfortable talking about sex and money and you're an expert in the money and sex world, you are a very, very powerful person. And I think I love doing this show. And thank you for coming to the show because I think sometimes people get really nervous talking about sex. But it's good to talk about this. And if your sons or daughters or nephews or nieces know that you're comfortable with sex, they're always going to come to you for help. And I think this will make the world a better place. So before I go, if you think we live in a sad, lonely, perverted world, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes it takes a pervert to make a better world. Thank you very much. I hope you like the show. Can I ask a question? Yeah, go ask. Can I take a quick... I've been taking pictures of everything during the show. Yeah, please ask. I mean, you said at the podcast, I see this couple of us were sitting outside the queue. You said that porn is more pro-feminine than... I don't know if I have it correctly. I got in trouble for that, by the way. Did you? Oh. Yeah. I say porn is more pro-women than fashion magazines. The reason why I say that, because if you look at porn magazines, what kind of women do they... First of all, fashion is run by whom? Gay men and women, right? And what kind of body type is that? They are almost like 5'10\", 5'11\", 6 feet and 110 pounds. They're very skinny. I work in porn business for 25 plus years. I have never heard any customer say, do you have a porn, she's 6 feet tall and 110 pounds? Never. But you know what, ladies? They always ask, do you have fat women, ugly women, women with one arm, women with facial hair? See, I don't know. You guys are beautiful. You always try to make yourself beautiful, but you're not doing for men. You're doing for other women. For real. We only care if you're naked. We don't care what you're wearing, to be honest, right? But to me, that's harsh, because I think so many women are starving themselves because they want to look like those fashion models. Can I say something? Most men don't even like women. They like thick women. We do. We like women with firm ass and tits. I work for John Stoliano, a butt man, Rocco's buddy. And yeah, so that's why I meant like a body type wise. I think porn is more pro-women because you have short women. Realistic. Yes. Fashion is not realistic. You're this much tall and like 50 kilograms. That's crazy. That's why I say porn is more pro-women. How did you get in trouble for that? Somebody said, porn is anti-women. You shut your .",
