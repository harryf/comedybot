    "text": "They're so good at finding out and they say that. And they say over and over until you break down and start crying. That's when this guy was saying a couple guys that have sex with him. He'll do shit like that. So, when Bush became president a second time, he left the business, he disappeared. And we've been working the last three years doing documents. And there's a reason why he disappeared. We think, I think he killed somebody. We're getting that information. And two, his name is Mark Handel. His brother, Bill Handel, is conservative radio personality that a lot of people don't know. He used to have a show before Rush Limbaugh. So, when 9-11, when that thing happened, Bill Handel was doing a radio show before Rush and they came to get him. Anyway, there is a lot of really weird individuals involved. There's plenty of people doing sex. They love women. They want to talk to ladies. And I like the directors looking at ladies and talking to them. What are you into? Are you into this and that? And ask before the show if they film it. I like directors like that because they want to do things that women are into. And make the scene even better. And other extremists, guys who want to hurt women, they could find out right away what they're not into. And they will lie and do the same. So, we're going after him. And he's in jail for tax evasion, weirdly. That's how you get people in the media. Yeah, I mean, you get to rape women and not go to jail. But if you fuck with, when you fuck the US government money, you go to jail. That's a very Swiss way of looking at it. But, yeah. We have one more question over here. Well, since Harry's question essentially covers some of it, but I have a little bit more on that. So, thank you for sharing all this. I really appreciate that you're available to talk about this. And if you're not available to talk more, you know, like... So, I remember watching this documentary and we were talking about this. The Dark Side of Porn was a documentary. That guy's in there. Condesh is in there. So, that was a BBC documentary. Yeah. And these people whose lives are ruined, right, because of some of these issues that you talked about. So, for instance, there is no consent, right? So, they end up, you know, like, because they cannot... There's some consent and some... It's supposed to stop as soon as someone decides they're no longer okay with it. But it goes on because there are so many other people. They're making money. They need to make the money. And there's a lot of pressure. So, it goes on. Although, that lady or the guy or the gal, right? It could be both ways. But it's... One imagines it's most of the times the women who do not want to do it anymore or something like that. I guess you could... So, and then there's the extreme case of it. And that's what I wanted to ask you about. Sure. So, diseases. Life-ruining diseases. Have you seen any of that sort of thing happen? And essentially people... How does the conversation go from there, right? Because essentially that kind of thing... You don't have a disease? Yeah. HIV. Gonorrhea? Yeah. You know, essentially you were talking about someone on stage with a very serious disease. And I just wonder if... Like, what happens after that, right? So, is that person... Is there any Italian people here? Okay. So, no. It's good. There's two extreme examples. I'm sure some of you know Rocco Cervetti, right? Yes. Okay. When I asked Rocco about that one time, the way he said that, like, I think he had gonorrhea multiple times or stuff like that. And, you know, in US military, you almost get killed and in bravery they give you purple heart. The way Rocco saw it, it was like getting gonorrhea. It's like his own version of purple heart. He kind of laughed about getting all kinds of different things. But... But my boss, John Stagliano, he tested positive HIV in 1997. And his wife, Karen Stagliano, tested positive HIV. And that's why we covered the pandemic where a guy named Mark Wallace, he knew he had HIV, but he put a fake testing. And so whenever there's incidents, one, I don't want this to happen. And two, it's a selfish reason. I don't want people who I know to have it. I don't want anybody to have it, but especially worse is you know somebody, you know? So whenever that happens, the industry shut down, where we do this, okay, these people have, they tested HIV. We do the backward track, like, okay, here's six or eight people. And we do another graph where who else did. So all the people we have, we go back like three months and we contact everyone and test all those people. So when COVID happened, the government or the basketball industry had to treat that shit? It's funny because in our documentary, we had, who, why am I forgetting, the head COVID czar of the USA. He's, we had him in our documentary. You know, really, as much sex they have in porn, it's amazing how little HIV positive thing happened, really. You know the thing, the thing I'm getting at, but it's an old stuff from you. I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but it's a really good question. Is, is if you look at it, like if I think about my working life, I've always worked in software. There's always some people in your company who are that, it's like that, it's usually a guy, it's usually that guy. And, and what I'm getting from you is this is, this is business, this is a company you've got people you work with. And there's always some people that push it too far. And it's really a question of A, what your personally, what your boundaries are, what you stand up for. Were you prepared to say, hey, no, this is not okay. It's an individual. Yeah. It's also like the culture around you, whether you've got people who say, hey, what you were doing to that person, that's not freaking cool. But can I also tell you something? Um, um, what was acceptable in eighties and nineties and two thousands different now. So sometimes when people say like, you know what, even some of the guy probably told me like it was acceptable back in 20 years ago, but now I feel like, um, I mean, you know, they would. And I think it's important to have that kind of understanding of what the culture is. And I think that's the most important thing. And I think it's a good example for you. What is a good example? Um, well, it's complicated because sometimes the girls need the money, so they say yes, knowing that they don't want to buy, you know, they will do seem even though they consented, they don't want to do it because of the money or whatnot. But that sounds like most of the jobs I've had in my life. That's true. But you don't have to addiction to answer why either. You don't know that. I mean, so you're right. You're right. I mean, so you're on Sunday night. It felt like it. Okay. Fair enough. We have one more question over here. Do you want to, do you want to finish this? I want to tell you something because, um, I know a lot of people talk about pornography. Um, they'd say a lot of goofy stuff cause they never worked in, but, um, I feel so conflicted because there's the good and bad and ugly. I want to tell you this one quick thing and then maybe we could get out. This is the kind of thing that really made me change and think about, um, people who are like, Oh, I'm not going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. This is what I'm gonna do. This is what I'm going to do. Um, when I was working at the Time of Video Store one time, a customer walked in and uh, say hello and, but uh, I thought maybe he was shy. I see going, walking around and looking for tape and that's a mirror of the night, like one in the morning. It's snowing and we were getting a lot of customers and then, um, it intershines so I don't want to bother, but he walked up and said, Hey, so could you help me and find a movie? And I'm sure that's my job. Um, to help you find a movie. And, um, he said, um, I need your help. Can you help me with the subject matter? I need you to help me find my daughter. So, you know, so me when I heard that, I'm a comedian so I'm laughing inside, so I thought maybe he found out that his daughter's doing a porn, and get one to get a copy and evidence. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. What happened was, what happened was his daughter got killed in a car accident. And when she was going to college, it's one of those nights when her and her friends, girls night out, I don't know how it is over here, but there was strip club, right? And when they went to strip club, it just happened that night, they were shooting a scene at the strip club for one of the porno movie. So what happened was, it was literally, they were shooting the audience scene, when you're walking you have to agree, like they're gonna film it, they're okay. So the reason why he was asked for this movie is literally the last live footage of his daughter in background at the strip club, you know? I'm a pervert, I'm not a monster, I wanna help him find the movie, but he doesn't have a title, he doesn't have production, none of it, right? So you gotta understand, I have like close to 10,000 copies. He's visiting from Canada, his flight is on 560 Honours. I mean, assuming even if we have the tape here, how do I find it, because it's not like a porn star name, I'm gonna collect the stage name. So I'm doing my best ability, like, he told me the kind of scene, I'm picking a movie, and we have a video, she says, we put the tape, we're fast forward looking for him, or looking for her, and every time a customer comes in, I have to stop. And like one hour pass, two hour pass, three hour pass, I'm getting desperate, I really wanna help him, but I'm desperate, and we can't find the movie, and then, so what I did was, I called one of the customer that shops a lot, we call him the Yoda perversion, because he was so much more, he knows a lot, so we called him 6 AM, you know, and he was so angry, because he told his wife, he doesn't watch porn anymore, and this motherfucker watched a lot of porn, right? So, Glenn, I didn't know what to do, you know, I wanna help the guy, I was watching, he's mad, but after I told him the situation, he's got a daughter too, like he wanna help, so he said, you check here and here and here and here, and I told him, of course, I'm not an idiot, I went to all those places, so he said, did you look at the gay section? I said, Glenn, we're looking for a bunch of male strippers dancing for these ladies, you don't understand, many of the male strippers are gay men, so chances are, you're probably finding a gay section, so I didn't know that, because you know, I think at that point, it was like half a year into it, I'm still learning, so I went to gay section, look at the, because I didn't even bother that section, I went through all the movie, I looked at the box cover, and I looked at the ones, like guys from like, strip club or whatever, you know, like I didn't, so I took like 40 of those, and I think like, within 30, 40 minutes, we find the fucking date with his daughter in it, and you know, and you have a daughter too, like that's the first time I saw a guy cry at the porn shop, you know, that's not a really common human, most guys, you know, they take them, take them, they're like, they're happy, they're gonna go, oh, I'm jacked off to it, crying is not one of them, but anyway, I think when I had experience like that, you know, I don't have a kid, I help them, and I did a show with Amber last year, and the name of the show is, Adult Content, and it's a, I misunderstood the phrase when I heard it, when I was kid, I thought it meant, adult content as in happiness, I thought, so my show was about, adult happiness, because a lot of time, it, sex is overrated, it's never as good as you think it is when you have sex with someone for the first time, the fantasy's so much better than the real thing, and a lot of time, when I'm dealing with a customer,",
