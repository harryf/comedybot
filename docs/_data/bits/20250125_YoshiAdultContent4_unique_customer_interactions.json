    "text": "She's going to sue you. Yeah. No, I won't sue you. So, you know, and, um... So there's times I'm able to be very generous sometimes, right? At work in the store, because I want to make money, of course, but you want to help people, too. And, uh, I went into porn... I went into porn trying to make money, but I found out that, um... If you think I'm awful now, I was far worse when I was younger. So porn kind of helped me treat people better, because I think it gave me an opportunity to be generous sometimes. Because one time a guy walked in, really good looking. He looked like Daniel Craig, the guy who used to play James Bond. Good looking guy, Ralph Lauren jacket, uh, uh, I mean, just really, like, well dressed, good looking. Walked in, I said, hello, it's one in the morning. He didn't say anything. So, like, you know, maybe he's shy, so I just let him go. He's walking around, and eventually he walked up to me, sir, um, could you help me with a movie? Of course, that's my job. So I asked, like, do you have the porn star's name? Do you have company name, fetish, uh, the director's name? On and on, every question's no. So I said, sir, you know, we have about almost 11,000 titles. Assuming even if you have the movie, I don't know if I can help you find a movie, because, you know, every thing I ask is no. And he said, well, if you look down, kind of sad. Well, I really, really need you to help me. Um, and kind of pause, like, you could hear in the back of your throat, like, you gotta help me find my daughter. Yeah. I was like, well, my response was, I was laughing inside. I'll be honest, I was being jerked off. So I thought maybe his daughter's doing porn, he needs evidence to confront his daughter. That's what I thought, right? Or, he could be Mormon, he just went jack off to it. So anyway, um, they're very special people. Alright. Wait, which canton in Switzerland have incest a lot? Which one is it? They always have an answer! They always have an answer to that one. Yeah, fucking cousin fuckers. Alright, anyway. Okay, so this is a scenario, right? Um, I'm trying to get more information. So this is what happened. His daughter got killed in a car accident like six, seven months before. And a year before, uh, I don't know if it's in Switzerland, but in America sometimes you have college girls' night out. They go strip club, like fun, you know, they see men dance or whatever. So they went, they just happened to be filming a porno movie. So they were like extra. So these girls are in the audience, cheering, having fun, they were filming for like one of the porn movies. So they were kinda extra. So literally, this is his daughter's last live footage. So he's visiting from Canada, you know, and, um, wanna find it. I mean, you know, I'm a pervert, but I'm not a monster. I'm gonna help this guy. I don't have a kid, but like, I can't even imagine. So, I'm using my what little porn power I have. I'm making an educated, kids-getty movie. Maybe she's alright. But, you know, I'm fast forward, look in the box, and fast forward, it goes from 1 to 2, 3, 4 AM. I'm getting desperate because I really wanna help this guy, right? But he's going to see town, going back to Canada. So I'm desperate, and every time customers come in, you know, they're buying a butt plug or something, you know, get the cash. They leave. So, you know, stuff like that. So I got desperate around 6, because, you know, pretty soon you need to go to the airport. So I call one of the customers, Glenn. You know, he's the number one customer at the airport. He's been buying shit since like 1973 or something like that. So like, he really is Yoda of perversity, right? You know, he even look like Yoda. Anyway, so when I called Glenn, he was upset because he told his wife he stopped watching porn, which is a complete fucking lie. He's a fucking addict. But after I told him, you know, here's the circumstance, this guy's looking for his daughter. Like, you know, he's got kids too. He wanna help. So he said, Yoshi, did you check A, B, C, D, E different fetish section? Of course. Did you check this company? So he said, did you check the green and yellow section? So, when people used to rent movies, we put different stickers, right? Like, red means heterosexual, purple means bondage. So like, easy to put movies back in the box, right? Yellow, yellow, green, and blue, um, yellow means bisexual, green means transgender, blue means gay. So he told me, did you check that section? I said, Glenn, I told you, I'm looking for a girl. He said, Yoshi, you don't understand. Many of the male strippers are gay, they dance for the ladies, so you might see them in a movie where they're like, gay movies or whatever, but there's ladies cheering. And in fact, a lot of times when ladies see two gay men suck each other, they kinda cheer on. I didn't know that, cause I don't watch that shit, right? So, I'm into the gay section, and I think we took like, I don't know, like 30 movies. Within 40 minutes, we fucking found her in one of the movies. And you know, um, he started crying. And, yeah, it's not fun to see anybody crying at a porn shop, cause that's not the behavior you see a lot. I mean, I'm used to seeing liquid come out of the body in a porn shop, but not from there, okay? So anyway, so I helped him. So like, it's situations like that it does make me feel, makes me feel better. That, you know, thank God, God made me pervert, right? So, um, I mean, it's one of those, one out of a thousand times I have to do good things, you know? So, um, so I think I, um, for me, working at Taibu Video Store, um, oh, you know, here's an interesting rule. Back in the late 90s, um, if you want, I'm sure German people like this part. Back in the 90s, there's only two cities you could buy VHS and DVD movies with shit in it. New York City and Portland, Oregon for some reason. So one time, they transferred me to Portland's Taibu Video Store, like, Old Road Pacific and Northwest, so I had to work at Taibu Video Store in Portland, right? So you know what happened? So, um, I was shocked cause we canceled shit porn. In, in, in, in Seattle. By the way, there's, there's a two kind of shit porn, I, I, I'm glad I could educate you on this. So there's Japanese and German ones, right? Now, Japanese people like, Japanese people like, uh, uh, um, smooth shit. So that, have you had a smooth shit come out of your ass? It's just like, it just, it goes straight into the water. It looked like a German boat, you know what I'm talking about? So, Japanese like shit that kinda bounce off their chest, right? But German's like the thick, chunky monkey shit, right? Like, you know, it's got kinda girth to their shit. You know, sometimes they have penises. Anyway, German would kinda stick on you, right? They'd be like, so anyway. So we, we have like Japanese and German shit, right? American shit porn, they're not that good. Germans, Germans, and Japanese, you know, they're like the, uh, Lexus and Mercedes of shit porn, right? And Americans like, eh, you know. So anyway, one time this motherfucker walked up to the shit porn area, he, he looked right, he looked left, this motherfucker, Poguespan, took a shit right there in the front of the building. Well guess what? I was working, so guess who had to clean up that shit from the carpet? This kid right here, right? And this customer saw that, he didn't do anything, he, you know what this fucking customer came up? Hey, uh, Yoshi, Hey Yoshi, how much is that shit on the carpet? Get the fuck outta here, right? Get the fuck out. Family, what could you do? Okay, anyway, um, yeah, so, so, you know, like, you learn so much about people that you really don't wanna know, right? And, um, another time, this motherfucker walked in, he is my grandmother's preacher, walking to the porn shop, so I go, oh, like that, he goes, oh, like that, he got the fuck outta here, you know what this guy said? This fucking piece of shit, he said, oh, I went to porn shop to save Yoshi, so get the fuck outta here. I, I, he has, he has a rental history, all, pissing video that he watched, right? Stop lying to me. He's an Asian preacher, if you wanna piss, I mean, we all we're already yellow, why do you need to piss on Asian people, right? Oh, man. Who brought the witch in here? Um, I got sick of working at the porn shop, by the way, if you get sick, and it's making you sick, and you don't wanna stay here, don't, I'm not gonna attack you, if you wanna leave,",
