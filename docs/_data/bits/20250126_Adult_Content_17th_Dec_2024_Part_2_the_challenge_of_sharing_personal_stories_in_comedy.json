But sometimes after the show, when people say they really enjoyed it, sometimes when I talk about sex stuff, they don't have a therapist, so they have somebody to talk to. That's giving me a little bit of pleasure. I feel like at least one out of 200 did something good. That was a fantastic question. Thank you very, very much. No, no, no. I thought for a second you were going to ask him sarcastic. I'm like, well, that's actually a really good question. Guys, this has been the show. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for listening.",
