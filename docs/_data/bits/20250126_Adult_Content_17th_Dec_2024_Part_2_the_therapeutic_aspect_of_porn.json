    "text": "I also like, honestly, sometimes when people feel embarrassed, I tell them I'm a pervert or whatever. And people are afraid to ask this question. I had a client at Taboo. She's a Holocaust survivor. Her husband passed away. She never grew up in an environment where people use that kind of language. They say, I want you to touch me this way and that. They never had that. And I think... I know it sounds like a really goofy thing to say, but I think happy sex and orgasm is a human right. I think it's a part of happiness, you know? But it wasn't that her husband was bad. It's just they grew up in a generation. You just never talk about these things. Right? Like even for most of the people here, especially younger, what does our parents always say? No kids, no kids, no kids for years. I'm a grandkid. What the fuck? Like you said, that's a huge leap, isn't it? So you need people like me because sometimes my friend's kids... You need people like me. Sometimes my friend's kids, when they were younger, email me, like, I heard you work in porn. I have a question. I'm not afraid talking about it. I'm not expert. I don't know how to do women orgasm. That's a problem. But I'm not afraid to talk to kids. But I'll still... I'll still talk to my friend's kids. Like, I don't mind talking to you, but I don't feel good about behind their back talking to you. So you should talk to your parents. And if you're afraid, you get permission from your parents if you talk to me. Because I don't want... You know what I mean? I don't want... If you're an adult, I don't want to make anybody embarrassed. You know? That's why I make the most ridiculous person. Because a lot of people say, well, why would this person judge me? He's a scumbag at a porn shop. So you should talk to me. To help people was what really was fun part.",
