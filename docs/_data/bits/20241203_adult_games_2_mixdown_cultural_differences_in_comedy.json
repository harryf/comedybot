One of the many things that makes black America great, they will tell you the same thing if you're black or if you're in the same generation. They will tell you this and that. It's not just a black person, but they will tell you that you're black. If you don't know the same thing, you're black. You're a black person, but you're a black person. I don't know if it's true, but I think this is a black person. I think you need to explain what a black person is. Is that kind of like a darkroom? Oh, sorry. I used to have black people and this is a great thing, but one of the many things that makes black American great, they will tell you the truth even if you don't ask for it. And if they're not doing well, they will... But you guys are so polite and I guess in Switzerland you don't like confrontation, so even if you don't like something, you don't tell me, you know.",
