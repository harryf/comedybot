    "text": "You don't have to remember the era where, there was something strange going on in America in the 90s because, you know, as you know, in the 90s, it was the end of the millennium. And whenever they come to the end of the new century or millennium, people do all kinds of weird. So there was a lot of weird shit going on in the United States, you know. I couldn't give you a detail. For some reason, back in the 90s when they were doing porn, whereas, you know, 70s and 80s, because of obscenity case, every movie had to have a story and some kind of educational value. Well, once they was like, yeah. You have to have some kind of educated or something creative. There was a case in late 80s where that's Los Angeles County went after a pornographer and the pornographer won the case. So what happened, they sent message to the rest of the country where pornographers from New York and San Francisco were having a lot of issues. They decided to move to LA. And there was a reason why I was telling that. Except for... All alone. What's that? Anyway. So from 90s on, they just started making movies where there's no educational value or stories. That's where my boss, John Steele, John Steele, aka, Buttman, he makes movies with women and big asses, changed the business. He started doing this thing called gonzo porn, which is just like in Contra S. Thompson, who is a very famous American author that Johnny Depp liked, Fear and Loathing in Vegas, where the journalist is the part of the story. So when he's filming porn as a gonzo pornographer, John, aka, Buttman is part of the story. And that became very, very popular from 80s to 90s. But around mid-90s, around the time when extreme sports was getting popular, they started doing a lot of extreme porn stuff that wasn't really safe. Like, you know, I knew a lady named Annabelle Chung. She did like first 200, Game Bang with 200 guys. And then... Just Men St. Clair did like 300 ones. So... In one sitting, that's what you're saying. Yes, but... We're probably wrong term. We're probably wrong term theater sitting. This is how anal I am because... I went to one of those things with other people, and like, this is a fucking lie. Because what they happen is, sometimes a guy with multiple scenes counts like three times. That's not three guys. That's fucking... They cheated on the one right there. Yeah, so I was getting kind of angry because... I have to do two, two, five, seven, and keep track and things like that. I mean, yes, it's ridiculous that I expect honesty in pornography like a CPA or something like that. So they were doing all kinds of weird stuff. And I have a little question. Who... So porn had to be educational value. Is that... To protect from obscenity case, yeah. Who has the job to decide where to porn it? Like, who is deciding that? Well, district attorney, and they have to ask... No, district attorney, juror of the community. What, 12 of your peers? Yeah, really. No, no, that's... That really comes down to that. So they're like, I've learned something. But you... But you got to remember, this kind of stuff's kind of stunning in Europe because for centuries, it wasn't obscenity case, it was blasphemy, where you did something against God and things like that. And it was... That was going for, like, millenniums in Europe. And then... And, you know, when... It's kind of funny to say this country, but when someone like Nietzsche said God is dead, blasphemy and the religious stuff no longer was relevant because most educated Europeans stopped not believing in God. So what's the other thing that the state could go after someone? The anti-God and anti-religious stuff? The anti-God and anti-religious stuff was replaced by obscenity. So you have a situation like James Joyce Ulysses or Lady Shelley's Lovers where government are going after people by obscenity cases. And that's not really spread to the United States. And 1969, Curious Yellow... Yep, 69, let's go. Oh, yeah. All right, no one? Okay, cool, let's just... Nice. The year I was born, Denmark legalized pornography. In 69. And then... Charm and Tribulation. Because back then, if you put pornography as a documentary, you're technically protected in New York City. And it was just like a huge business in New York because Nickelodeon, you know, you put a recorder, you watch a show, they start putting pornography in. So New York City, Manhattan, because hotbed, eventually just spread to places like San Francisco and L.A. But each city had a different kind of style of pornography, you know. Different stories. Well, this going to channel, this is where you miss the market there. New York City was very, very dark and edgy. San Francisco was more academic and creative story. And L.A. was very like, you know, like California girl, blonde hair, big boobs, kind of fun kind of thing, you know.",
