    "text": "I went. So I ended up talking to three foreigners. One American, one English, Australian. I don't know which commit which, but it was like tax evasion, murder and drug. And the murder got less years than whatever. But so she's talking to a bunch of them. So I'm in the courtyard inside of the prison and they don't know me. And they're suspicious until Kim told them. By the way, you should work for porn. So here's the thing. When you work for porn, just like I don't think you ever saw the show Generation Kill. They embedded this guy. He was a journalist. The only reason Marine trusted him because prior to become real journalist, he wrote for Hustler and every young guy don't trust New York Times, but they definitely trust Hustler magazine. So when you work in porn, even, even though racial thing, you could surpass that because soon as I told him like, for no stopping it, when they ask me questions, I know detail of all the different girls. Cause they think about it. What is porn? You have a bunch of people showing their ass. Holes. They're showing their dick and pussy, their tits. They got liquid on over them. It's, it's, it's, it's a very odd. They don't really hide anything. Do they? Right. So it's most honest people you ever going to meet most down to earth people.",
