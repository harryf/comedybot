    "text": "I immigrated to the United States, and I noticed that, this is a wonderful thing, but when I deal with Latina, especially black people, if they have a disagreement with you, they just clear that, black people tell you the truth, whether you wanna hear it or not, United States. But once you have a big argument, you can say, oh, no. You're a black man, they'll call you, you know, you yellow motherfucker, and go back and forth. But it's wonderful, once we clear the air, we have a hug out, and everything's done. I noticed that's not really possible with Japanese-English people. You know, if you have a disagreement, do you guys, English people do hug out when there's a problem? Yeah, we do the same thing, Japanese do the same thing. We don't hug out, we do exactly what English people do, you know, which is we invade other countries, and... That's why they were dangerous. I have some, this feel like a home, because, you know, we're polite, but dangerous, okay. I just wanna make that point.",
