    "text": "But, alright, so have we got, you all look mostly disgustingly young. Have we got any parents here tonight? Parents, give me some, okay, a little bit of Alfredo noise. But the rest of you guys, why are you not breeding? No, you see, I'm a dad myself, and it annoys me, it really does. I've got this friend, every time we talk about this, she's like, the way the world is today, I just don't know if I want to have children. And I'm like, okay, look, as a dad, I understand, because having children is shit. But, yeah. These people are never breeding, they're laughing too long about that. No, but the thing is, just think about this for a second, human beings have been on the planet for more than 300,000 years. And sex only got good about 23 years ago. No, we only invented soap about 100 years ago. And consent about 5 years ago. I mean, I know, you're laughing way too much at that. But the thing is, do you understand, like, how much traumatic shit the human race had to go through over 300,000 years, and now all of you guys here are going like, ah. I'd just rather drink a green tea frappuccino with oat milk. Like, what the fuck, like, for all your ancestors, make some kids guys. And the thing is, having kids is easy now, it's so easy, they just unzip your stomach and out pops the kid. And then you hand them an iPad, you're finished. Yeah, Jesus Christ.",
