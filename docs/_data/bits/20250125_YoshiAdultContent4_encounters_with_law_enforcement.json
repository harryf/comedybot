    "text": "he'll put a pumpkin on top of his dick. Christmas time, he puts Santa Claus up on his dick, right? And of course, 9-11, he would put NYPD blue helmet on top of his dick. So, you know, I love my country, so I salute the dick. So anyway, but something about my personality, people keep sending me dick pictures, you know, and I don't like it. I tell them to stop. Alright. Alright. One time, but, you know, um, there's been times when pornography kind of saved my life. One year, you know, my dad passed away and my cousin passed away within a week, so I was not in a good mood, and I was going up to Seattle for my cousin's funeral, and I took their own bag, and airport, I had a weapon in my bag, I completely forgot. You know, you know what? Collapsible batonius, like a stick, you go like this, it becomes big. So like, it's kind of, you know, I used to work in porn, and it got robbed, so I have that. And, and, uh, I don't know if you could see, but I had, like, I got, you know, attacked by homeless people at the shop. Anyway, so I had a weapon in my bag, right? So, I get arrested on September 11, 2003. So they think I'm a terrorist because I have a weapon in my bag, right? So, I don't know how it is in prison, in jail, in Switzerland, I'm sure it's the lines, so they're not. Here, here's the thing. Here's the problem. When they took me to jail, that's the first time I went to jail. It's really scary for me because if you go to the American prison system, it's basically, you have to go into your group. So all the blacks are over there, all the Latino and all the white people. Here's the problem. Asian people don't commit crime. So I'm in a corner with a Samoan guy in a man in a women's outfit. That's my team, right? There's just three of us. There's hundreds of black people over here. Hundreds of Latino and hundreds of, and I'm just, you know, I don't know how to fight. I mean, I look, I'm Asian, so I look like I know how to fight. But, I mean, So I'm panicking, like, you know, I just think every prison is like, oh my god, I'm gonna get raped, right? And, uh, Why am I afraid of that? You know, I'm afraid I might enjoy it. But anyway, so I don't know. I've never been, I don't know what's gonna happen. So I'm really nervous. And then, uh, this black guy walked up to me, right? Like, oh no. Because I don't know if you know, there's been friction between Asians and black people in Los Angeles for a while. So I thought, oh my god, I'm gonna have a problem. And he goes, hey bro, where did you get that t-shirt, right? So I forgot, I'm wearing the Porn Company t-shirt. So, on my t-shirt, it has Adventures of Buttman, right? Just like, I'm a little scared because you don't want to be known as Buttman in jail, right? So, you know what I mean? That's, I was so scared I didn't even pay anything. So I had a Buttman. Okay, this is where it saved me. I said, oh, because I work for this company, isn't it interesting, usually they hate Asian people in jail, the white, blacks, and Latinos. But this is one thing, there's one thing that you can overcome, racism, which is perversity. Like, if you're pervert, sorry, I don't know why I keep looking at you, but anyway, Objection, you hold on. If you're pervert, people kind of overlook the difference, you know what I mean? Because, for anybody who's from here, from Germany, they have the biggest convention in Europe called Venus Fair in Berlin. So every October, right? And I think the first time I went was 2002, and look, I don't like stripes and all, I want people to get along, but it's interesting, it's the biggest porn in Europe, on Venus Fair, and this is the one time, it's amazing, it's wonderful, because people who traditionally hate each other, because there's a bunch of naked women running around, they're getting along. So like, black and white people are getting along, Jews and Muslims are getting along, Japanese with other Asian people, you know what I mean? Like, people that usually hate, because it's hard to be angry when you see tits and asses, right? It's really hard. You know what I mean? I think, maybe in Palestine, Jews, if they had a, you know, if naked people walked down the street, you know what I mean, sir? You know what I mean? Like, you have a bad day,",
