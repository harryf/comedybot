    "text": "I didn't make any money, but it is nice when you get to be a little generous with people, you know, because you don't get to do this all the time. And so that was cool. And sometimes, sometimes there's like the difficult things, you know, like I remember a guy walking at like 2 in the morning because at that time it was like snow, you know, I'm trapped in Seattle. I don't think I can have any customer. A guy walks in really well-dressed, Ralph Lauren jacket and really nice looking guy, late 40s, early 50s, late 90s, in an atypical custom porn shop. You know, people don't really dress that well for a shop like that. I said hello. He doesn't say anything. He walks in and then he starts shopping around. And, you know, because if they're shy, I'm gonna leave them alone. 10 minutes later, he walks up, he says, could you help me find a movie? Of course, you know, that's my job. So I asked him like, do you have this porn star's name, production company, fetish and things like that? Every question was no, no, no. And I told him, sir, you know, we have about 10, 11,000 titles in here. Even if we have the movie, you know, based on so little information, I don't know if I could help you with the movie you're looking for. And he paused. And looked down and said, well, I really hope you could help me find my daughter. And and of course, you know, my first reaction was, of course, you know, I was kind of laughing inside because I thought maybe she was doing a porn that I want to confront her whether I need a copy or something like that. And then I was like, you said that the police. I don't speak German, so I don't know. Sadly, I wish that was a scenario. What happened was after talking to him, his daughter got killed in a car accident six months before that. And about eight, nine, ten, maybe 11 months prior to that when she was going to college, one of the night, her and her friends had a gross night out with a strip club. And she was like, I'm going to go to the strip club. And they just happened to be filming extra scene for one of the porn of higher budget for the movie. And she just happened to be in the audience. And sounds like it's probably like last live footage of his daughter. So he's visiting from Canada. I would like to find this movie. And, you know, I'm a pervert, but I'm not a monster. I would like to help. But, you know, even if you have it, there's 11,000 VHS DVDs, right? So I want to help. I didn't want to do it. But I used my high pervert IQ trying to kind of guess which take might happen. So, you know, every time I'm playing, fast forward, we can't find the girl, a customer coming, I can stop. You know, a couple hours later, I'm still getting the phone. So it's like one, two, three, five, six, seven AM. He's got to fly at noon. I've got to leave soon. I don't think my coworkers replacing me will be very favorable trying to help this guy. So I didn't know what to do. So I made an executive decision. I called Glenn, who's like number one porn customer. They shopped with him for a long time. He's like my porn Yoda, right? So I called him. And he was very upset because, first of all, two reasons. One, it was very early in the morning, and he told his wife he doesn't watch porn anymore. It's a fucking lie. It's a lie because he doesn't buy movies. But what he does, he goes into those booths, put quarters, watch porn all day. So the fuckers still watch. But anyway, after explaining to him the situation, of course, he's got kids too. So he asked me, Yoshi, did you go this section, this section? I'm like, Glenn, I'm not an idiot. Of course I went. Then he said, Yoshi, did you go to the yellow and green section? And yellow and green, back then we have a different sticker for different movies that we see. So that's the pretty things bad. So red is heterosexual, blacks and BDSM. And then blue and yellow, blue and yellow was like gay and transgender porn. So like, why would I be yellow and, you know, those colors? Because many of the strippers tend to be gay men. They dance with women. So if you haven't had a chance to find the tape, why don't you check the gay section? So I went there and I took my educated kids based on the box. And I think 35, 40 men in my, we fucking find a movie with his daughter in it. And, you know, it's really weird because they start crying. And usually men usually don't cry at porn shop. I mean, liquid does come out of the box. Liquid does come out of the body, but that's not the body part. You know. So it's a privilege when I have a chance to do stuff like that. Now, I don't know, I have too much hair, but I don't know if you can see a circle here. Kind of. No? Yeah. So Easter 2000, you know what's interesting? Holidays, the porn shop, the most busiest. Because they don't want to spend their family time with their family, with their stupid family. So they come to the porn shop on Christmas, Easter, and things like that. We make so much more money. But, so this guy comes in and clearly he shoplifting. So I stop him by the door entrance way. I didn't know at the time. He just got out of prison that day. And he took PCP, which is like a horse tranquilizer. They give you a lot of strength. And I didn't know that. He's a small little fucker. I thought I could take him. Not true. And he pushed me through the door, hit my head against the pole. He takes off. So I'm an idiot. I just run up and grab him. He grabbed me and flipped me over the first time. I run back. I grab him. He flipped me the second time. And I'm trying to do my, I got 50 pounds. Well, okay. So I can't do metric. But anyway. So long. Sorry. In America, you know who knows metric system? Gun nuts and drug dealers. Criminals. So third time, my partner ran out with a baseball bat. He knocked him out. So it can be dangerous. And these are the kind of shit we deal with. Another time, I'm in a hospital. I'm in a hospital. They don't trust them. And look.",
