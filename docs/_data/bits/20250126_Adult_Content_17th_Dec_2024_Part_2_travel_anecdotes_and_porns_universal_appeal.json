    "text": "And when I went to Afghanistan, I went to Afghanistan for vacation three times in my life. For vacations? Yeah. I know people. This is more of a question. Like I'm going to Ukraine January 1st. Anyway, so. Have you seen the beaches? They're amazing. And empty. My friend Kim, she's American practicing law in Afghanistan. She said, hey, you want to go to Policharki prison, which is the biggest prison in Afghanistan? Of course. I mean, you know, she would never ask a black person to go to prison. So even though it's their natural habitat, they're not going to go to prison. So I'm like, I'm going to go to prison. I'm going to go to prison. So I went, so I ended up talking to three foreigners. One American, one English, Australian, I don't know which,\u200b ict easily work, but it So she's talking to a bunch of them. So I'm in the courtyard inside of the prison. And they don't know me. And they're suspicious. Until Kim told them, by the way, you should work for porn. So here's the thing. When you work for porn, just like, I don't know if you ever saw the show Generation Kill. They embedded this guy. He was a journalist. The only reason Marine trusted him, because prior to becoming a real journalist, he wrote for Hustler. And every young guy don't trust New York Times, but they definitely trust Hustler magazine. So when you work in porn, even the racial thing, you could surpass that. Because as soon as I told them, like, porno stuff, and when they ask me questions, I know the detail of all the different girls. Because think about it. What is porn? You have a bunch of people showing their assholes. They're showing their dick and pussy, their tits. They got liquid all over them. It's a very honest. They don't really hide anything, do they? So it's the most honest people you're ever going to meet. The most down-to-earth people. As soon as I told porn, people like, black people usually don't like Asian people, right? But as soon as I work in porn, you know, I'm like a friend. You know what I mean? So that's my favorite part.",
