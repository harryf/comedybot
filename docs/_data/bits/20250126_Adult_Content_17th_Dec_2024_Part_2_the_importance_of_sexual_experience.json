    "text": "This this actually does answer the question. Do you guys remember what the question was? Can I do something? You know, one of my favorite things, you know, one of my favorite thing when I went to the porn shop, when I used to go to a porn convention, they used to go to the porn shop. And I was like, oh, I want to go to the porn convention in Vegas and have this porn girl sign autograph for customers. And you know how it is because you have the Internet. But back then, this was a huge thing. Like, Jin-Jin Lin would say, Johnny, eat my ass. You know, they sign it like that. Or Janet James would say, Tony, let me suck your cock, whatever. These are average guys. They're never going to have access to women that look like that. It makes them happy. So I was more than happy to go. I get autographed for them. But my most uncomfortable one was like I had friends or customers. They're dying from cancer. So I would bring sign items or audio clip. Hey, you better beat that cancer because I'm going to fuck you in Vegas. Things like that. You know what I mean? This is the cruelest Make-A-Wish that I've ever heard. But Make-A-Wish is cruel because you know what's the first thing kids ask? Can you get rid of my cancer? Sorry, Johnny. We could give you a second option. But you know what I mean? So like, it's really not about sex. Because, lady, I hate to tell you, sex is overrated. We know that. No. Wait, what? You said that with so much conviction. Yes. By now I know. Sex is absolutely overrated. And, too, it's not about sex. It's about sex. And, too, please don't take this wrong, but beautiful women are like cockroaches. They're everywhere. The amount of time we think about sex and all the things, we're trying to get obsessed, it's so disheartening. You know how many Hall of Fame perverts I know? And I talk to these guys, like, they're fucking 80s and 90s. It really bugs me. Like, do you still have this urge? It's like, yeah, oh my god. It's one of the few things that make me want to kill myself because I'm just sick of those urges and stuff. You know what I mean? Like, I don't want to be 88 and kicking my dick hard and thinking about, you know what I mean? Like, I'm sick of it. You're going to Kyiv. You're not going to make it to 88. So it's... I'm sorry. You know, another controversial thing that people get mad, but this is really, I'm serious when I say this. You know, when they have these 15, 16-year-old kids, they're like, oh, I'm going to be a sexist. And this is the first time I've seen 16-year-old kids. And they're dying from cancer. And they do want to do a nice thing for them. And I know they really mean well. But this... I'm not... I'm serious when I say this. I know they're trying to get them Super Bowl tickets to sign on. But you know a 15-year-old boy with cancer that only had six months to live, but they really need strippers, hookers, or porn stars. I know you feel uncomfortable, but... Well, you know. I hope... I hope your son doesn't have a cancer. I think he does. But if he has a cancer, he's got sex month, you better call me because... Letting that boy die without having big delicious titties hitting their faces, this is wrong.",
