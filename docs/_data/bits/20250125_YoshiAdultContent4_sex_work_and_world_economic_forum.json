    "text": "Can you imagine? Taliban runs fucking Afghanistan, I found, when do you find hookers in Afghanistan? You go to Chinese restaurants. True story. There's all the hookers who work there, because they're not Muslims. There's hookers there, right? So, any, so, you know, you guys know Anthony Bourdain? Yes. Okay, I'm on season one, episode two, the K-town episode, I mean, there, and I made him laugh because, Mr. Bourdain, I'm gonna be the Anthony Bourdain of sex. Which is kind of true, because I've been traveling anything sex related. So, um, I went to Greece, and they were, uh, there's, my friend was doing, like, a refugee camp, so my friend was helping, like, a lot of Syrian, uh, Palestinian, Afghan, and other, um, refugee camp in Athens. So he said, why don't you come and visit? So I went three days. What a bummer, right? Like, you know, I'm, I wanna help them, but, like, I didn't, I didn't feel good. So, I checked if there's a red light district in Athens. I'll be honest with you. So I found it, and there's a red light district in Athens, and if you go to this brothels, and if you see a girl that you like, you pay them, old lady, you stay in the room, and you wait your turn, and if the girl's popular, you gotta wait for a while, right? So what they do is, for you to not get frustrated and angry, each one of those rooms have TV playing porn. Okay. Do you realize how uncomfortable it is for me, sitting there waiting for a girl, and watching porn, the movie I worked on, on the monitor, right? It's really embarrassing, because it's one of the first ones where I could see all the mistakes I made. I'm really embarrassed. I'll be honest, I didn't, I did a good job. It's a little embarrassing. It's really embarrassing. And another embarrassing thing is when I started seeing my friends fucking. Because, you know, I know they act like studs or whores, but behind the scenes, this just worked for them. They have to support, they're taking care of their family. Whether you like it or not, you don't respect them, I'm just saying these are my friends fucking. It's a little uncomfortable, but it was really, really uncomfortable there, because as I'm looking, there's my friend Brandon Iron, he's Canadian, a good friend of mine, and I'm, I see him, it's a movie called Slap Happy. So, every time he has sex with a girl, after he slapped the girl in the face. I don't condone it, but that's the movie that he made, you know? And I'll be honest, it made me really uncomfortable, because it was the first time I see Brandon because three months before that, he killed himself. So he's you know, he's my friend, and and, um, you know, and any time I watch porn, I'm at the point where it's hard for me to watch porn because a lot of them disappear or they're dead. You know, for you guys, you guys are civilians. Right, civilians? But I believe in the world, you know, I know too much information what happened to them. When a girl disappeared because she wanted to start her life, I'm okay with that. I hope you're, if you can't, you know where a lot of porn girls move to restart their life. Salt Lake City. Because Salt Lake City is kind of like religious Switzerland. There's a lot of discrimination. Mormons will not say, hey, you're in porn. They're not gonna say that. Because saying that that means they watch porn. They can't never admit that. So a lot of porn girls move to Salt Lake City. They know that you know that they did porn, but nobody say anything. So there's a big porn neutrality in Salt Lake City. Right? So that's okay. Like, you wanna restart? But the one that bothers me when they disappear because they're fucking dead or something. You know, these are my friends. So, I'll be honest. When I saw Brandon, I didn't even know. I started crying. Because he was the first friend I made and I've known him for 20 years since 1999. And last thing any prostitute wanna see is walking in the room, the guy's crying. You know. So she took me out and I got to know them. So last six years, they be I go to Athens like three, four times a year. Not because hookers. I don't do that anymore. But I go there because I became friends with like five or six different brothels. So I bring money, candy, toys for the kids and stuff like that, you know. Yeah, like I'm like the Asian Santa Claus. Slanty Claus. So they became like family. Because one thing about sex workers, they never judge you. They really accept you. They treat you like a family member. So I'm very lucky because my mom said she wanna kill herself. When they see my face. It's really nice. I could go to a place. They're kinda happy to see me. Isn't it? Isn't it nice? We all have a place. I hope every one of us have a place. But I hope all of us have a place where we could go and be loved, right? I hope. I hope. I hope for everyone. So that's my place. And the reason I'm telling you, and I'll be done quick. I think the reason why there's a lot of terrible things happening in the world because there are people like this week in Switzerland, Davos, many rich and powerful people show up in Davos for World Economic Forum, right? I went two years ago. You know, I'm a whore whisperer. Soon as I went to Davos, right away, like, oh, she's a prostitute. You know, like, right away, I could tell. I could just smell it. Right? Right? Ladies, you know what I mean. You know what I mean. Like, ladies, I know ladies, I know some of you, you could tell right away who's got a big dick. Right? You could kinda tell. Like, what? You know what I mean? I noticed, like, guys good at dancing, that's always a good sign for ladies. You know, ladies, when you ride horses, you know, you have a certain rhythm, and guys who could dance, you know what I mean? There's a certain, you know, I can't dance shit, you know? So, like, I'm not popular, but you could tell right away who has this, like, sexual energy and things like that. When I went to World Economic Forum, this is what I learned over the years, because, um, rich people that doesn't have happy sex life, they don't have orgasm, you know what they do? These rich people? They fuck the poor. I listened. You know what I'm talking about, sir? Rich people get out fucking the poor people, right? Like, why? Ladies, I don't mean this, but, you know what I mean? Like, the way these guys think, why rape one girl when you could fire 10,000 people from your company? You just rape 10,000 people plus their fucking family. You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? You understand. So, they get off and fucking, that's why these rich people, because the reason I meet a lot of, when you work with a lot of sex workers, porn stars, you meet a lot of rich and famous people. I used to deliver porn to Tonight Show with Jay Leno, because one of my friends got on the show on Jay Leno night, 2007, and when my friend Jim told the producer of the show, Yoshi works in porn, so anytime there's famous Hollywood star or somebody famous on Tonight Show, they mention porn, they call me and I bring box of porn for famous people at Tonight Show. So, the people on my Facebook, I have pictures of famous people like Seth Rogen, who loves porn, and he's like, hey honey, he told his wife about porn. So, through sex workers at Tonight Show, I met so many fucking rich and powerful people. Now, I can't tell them their names, because, you know, the people who introduced me are going to get in trouble, but, that's the thing, like, they, they they fuck over people and they get off on that, you know. This is something that's really surprising to me. Because back then I thought, okay, they make a tough decision financially for company, for better economy, no, no, sometimes they really want to, they don't have to fire people, but they get off on fucking, you know, just, little before Christmas, fire them, they're being, oh my god, they get bonered, right? They just get so hard, like, just, they couldn't wait until January, no sir, fire them two days before Christmas, and just fuck them, right? So, so I met so many of them, right? And, and, here's the thing, I'll finish with this, um, you know Tom Wolfe, he's a very famous American writer? He had this phrase, very famous, he wrote like Rice Stuff, Bonfire Vanity, he coined the term Me Generation, direct, you know, he had this phrase, Masters of Universe. He meant like people in the 80s in America, Wall Street, they're so powerful, they make so much money, they get away with anything. Well these days, who are Masters of the Universe? These are, H-Pump manager, the billionaires, the head of the government, head of entertainment, military, academic, these are the most powerful people. They control everything. You know one thing they don't control? They can't control themselves. And when they're exposed, they usually have something to say, that's why they'll tell me like, you know this person that used to go to Obama, he's into kicking women in the head. What? True story, I'm not gonna tell who. This guy worked for Trump, he eats women's panties and shit like that, right? He's in the cabin. You know what I mean, like, when people used to rent porno from Tableau Video, like, oh my god, this guy used to be my ninth grade teacher. Like, you know what I mean, it's like Matrix, I see the world so different now because, you know what I mean, once you know too much information, like, oh my god, this head of Microsoft is into getting punched in nuts. I don't know, I don't like that finish. That makes sense. So, um, finally, um, so, do you guys know Jeffrey Epstein? Yeah. I know him. Luckily not personally. Yeah, we know him. I've been to Airbus, I've been to every single Jeffrey Epstein's properties, and I was one of the four person in the courtroom because it was under COVID policy when I saw him getting, when his ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, getting guilty verdict, December 29, 2021. I was one of the four, and there's other four spot for journalists, so I was in that, I was there for sentencing, I went to Trump case, Harvey Weinstein, Danny Masterson, who used to be the 70 show, he got convicted for rape, uh, S.B.F., Elizabeth Holmes, um, I just got back from France for Gisele Petticoat's case. I went there for that conviction, so I I literally went out, I shouldn't have done it, I pat her shoulder, I shouldn't have touched her without permission, but I say, you know, Merci beaucoup, Madame, whatever, you know, because, he said that it was amazing, this lady, for those of you who don't know the case, her husband used to drug her and rape her with a bunch of other guys, and she could have done a private case where it would have been preventing any public, no, she said, no, no, no, let the whole, no, let the whole world show what happened to me. That lady walked every day for a hundred days, let the whole world see what happened to her. Her head's up, and she, she didn't even feel bad for her, she felt bad for her kids, but she went, and um, so she went in, and, did you know this? Her husband was arrested, and he was in jail, but the fifty other rapists, they have to walk into court every day. Did you know? I thought they got arrested, so every day, this fucking guy, they covered their faces like, you know, illegal Mexican migrant workers, Mexican illegal workers, that sounds redundant, but anyway, um, they're all illegal, bye bye, Trump. Okay, anyway, um, so I was shocked, like, oh my god, like, I told, I don't speak French, like, oh my god, are they the rapists? Like, oui oui, you know, like, um, I, there's fifty rapists walking into court every day, right? So you know what I did? Um, when I used to work at a video store, every time these fuckers are stealing stuff, or they're trying to sneak into the booth, watch, um, they cause a lot of problems, right? I don't know if you could see, but I have a, like, a, I bought a crack head, I got, uh, thirty stitches because I got in a fight with myself. He was shoplifting dildo. Anyway, um, so I got beaten up. So after that I learned, there's a special place in a porn shop where if I hit somebody with a baseball bat, because of the angle of the camera, they can't see me swinging bat, so whenever like I'm hiding corner and hit this motherfucker, you see sometimes crack head flying across the room for some reason. So I used to hit people all the time because I, you're not doing this shit again, motherfucker. So this is what I did. Soon as I look over the shoulder, I see the rapist coming over, so I just kind of timed it, so one time I went like, like that, right? So I elbowed that rapist in the face, and said like, and, uh, oh, I'm sorry, so I said, uh, you know, uh, you know, I don't speak French, so ching chong, whatever, and, um, the second guy, I just kind of elbow and hit him in the chest. Nobody's complaining. It's great, right? I mean, I'm hitting rapists, right? Okay. Here's a problem. Third one, I'm typing it, and as I'm swinging, I don't know what happened, but as this rapist coming, this lady caught front of him, front, front, so I'm thinking like, like that, right? And I hit this lady with big tits. I just elbowed, and, uh, you know, so I apologized, and I stopped, and my Japanese friends were like, well, why don't you be more careful, keep hitting those, can you imagine, miss, can you imagine for a second? No. No, no, no, not, not the way, but can you imagine, I hit rapist one, two, third one, I hit the lady, right? But let's say on the fourth, and the fifth, and sixth, I missed the rapist, and all of a sudden, I just hit lady, like, number four lady, number five, like, all of a sudden, it looked like one, there was only one Asian guy there. Can you imagine, I hit number three, four, five, six lady, all of a sudden, you see this Asian guy just hitting women at the rape case, right? I'm not gonna do that! I'm not, so I, so I, I just stopped, right? So, I'm, I'm going to, uh, uh, doubles tomorrow with Harry. Because I don't have a special pass, right? I don't have a special pass, and and I think it was hard to go into one of the hotels, because they're all fancy people, and you have to have credentials. You know how, you know how I get into hotels? Every time I see representatives of Japan, China, Korea, all those Asian people, I kind of sneak behind them, like I'm the part of the group. I just kind of, and if there's something in French or whatever, then I just walk in, right? But tomorrow I'm going with Harry, with a white guy. That, that looks legit. So, um, so two minutes. The reason why I think we should have ethical pervers, like myself, kind of educating the public, because, because I think, um, when I was sitting in the room, uh, when they were, um, sentencing Glenn Maxwell, um, all the victims, it's a heartbreaker. All these girls, women now, victims' speech, right, like, they're just gonna tell the judge and the court how much impact this had in this. Now, they're in their 30s, 40s, even early 50s, but imagine 20, 30 years, they're just kids, right? And, uh, and even though they're older, in my head, I just see them as kids. Like, you just feel pain for these kids, you know, you just feel bad. And once they finish, uh, they're ready to have Glenn Maxwell, uh, sentencing her. You know what the defense said? Your Honor, Judge Nathan, Ms. Maxwell, she said, she would like to speak. So, like, we were all shocked because during the case, she never spoke one time. So she went up and spoke, right? I swear to God, it was really shocking. She spoke in that Cambridge, Oxford English. And this is a person who grew up in privilege. She literally grew up with kings and royal family. She's friends with Prince Andrew. She knew the president, all the billionaires. The way she spoke, imagine, like, a female version of Darth Vader. You know what I mean? Like, she, she, I'll be honest, she seduced me. Like, that, that voice. You know, I have Asian accent, it's not, it sounds funny, but when English people at the highest level speak in that language, my God, I mean, talk, my nipples are getting hard, right? So, so, when she spoke, I was like, I think maybe these kids are lying. That's how, that's how seductive, right? Ladies, imagine, you're 14, 15, 16 years old, right? You don't have a father. You come from poor neighborhood. You don't have any opportunity. You see this beautiful British lady with all that picture with famous people, she has all this money, access, and she's giving you and offering the whole world. Look, I was seduced. You think these girls have a chance? No fucking chance at all. You need people like me warning the public, like the danger of these kind of perverts, right? Like, I'm I'm kind of vaccinated to perversity. So, I'm here to like Prometheus fired the torch of truth, right? So, I think you need people like me kind of save them. And last one is, do you guys know the story of Oedipus Rex? King Oedipus, um, his father was king, and the fortune teller say, hey, your kid's gonna raise up, and when he's an adult he's gonna kill you and marry your wife. So, king said, I need to kill my son. Well, his servant didn't kill this kid and put this kid away, and somebody else raised the kid. When that kid realized, when he got old, his foster parents told him, the reason I'm gonna have you because prophecy said you're gonna kill your father and marry your mom. So, he fled thinking that's their real parents, right? Well, what happens, eventually he meets his real father, they're gonna fight, he kills the father, marries his mom, he becomes motherfucker. The reason I'm telling you, when you go to Davos, these rich people, they're saying, sustainability. They're saying to Davos, we're here to make the world a better place. They don't realize these are the same people who created the problem to begin with. And like the motherfucker that they are, they don't know that they caused the problem. So, I have to put a mirror to their face and say, no, no, no, no, sir. You're the problem. And you know how do I know? Because it takes a pervert to know another pervert. Alright guys, thank you very much. Sorry, I think we're too long.",
