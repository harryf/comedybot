    "text": "This kid's hand over. And that's the amazing thing about kids. They see good in everyone. And anybody who were porn, everybody's a scumbag. I forgot to tell you during the story. Because one time my friend Brandon Iron, a porn star from Canada, he called me, Hey Yoshi, could you help me with something? I thought he needs a camera guy. So this one, he's gonna fuck this girl. And afterward there's like 15 to 20 guys blow-bang. Blow-bang is where 20 guys put their dick and just come on her face. It's kind of similar to Bukkake, which is Japanese word. So I said, well if you don't need a camera man, what do you need? So here's the scenario. Brandon's gonna babysit a flake on him. So they need me babysitting those two girls, 5 and 7. I said, Brandon, I don't feel countable. Even if they don't shoot, he had to pay all these people. It's like $5,000 to go down the toilet. He can find anybody. So I show up, take the two kids to McDonald's. You know, they're white kids. What am I doing with white kids? I'm just like, oh my god, please don't ask me questions. And then, Mommy's at work. I get the food. And all this daughter, Sluffy, she's drinking vanilla milkshake. She had a vanilla milkshake all over her face. Which is ironic, the same thing is happening to mom. As we speak. I had to reconcile. Oh no. See, if you go to Japanese people, bukkake, they don't think sex. That's not something that most foreigners think. But for those of you, if you don't know what, bukkake is a type of noodle. And they give you a little bit of sauce. So it's just enough to spread across their face. That's why when you do bukkake, all the guys are ejaculating on the girl's face. That's why it's called bukkake film. But bukkake, 95% of Japanese people say, it's a type of noodle. It's kind of funny, because two people just walked in, and I'm talking about a fucking game. Sorry. This is actually the moment where we're going to wrap it up. I have time for one more question. Anyone? Was this show weird? Did I waste your time? Is there something that you want to hear more or less of? Because I always want you guys to think. I have one question. Yes. How much confidence, or should I say, how did you get into the position to talk in front of people when everybody's watching you? Especially in case of humor, which is quite individual. This is actually a very good question. I told them beginning of the show something happened with my mom was basically, I don't know, I was in a relationship with my mom. My mother was forced to marry my dad. And I had a very typical relationship. And I hate to say it, but I overheard my mom talking to her friend one time, drunk. Because I sneak met her on the downstairs. You know what she said to her friend? I should be laughing, but she said one time, every time she sees my face, she wants to kill herself. Aww, you're beautiful. So... It's fine. It's kind of funny now, but at the time I didn't really take it that way. But I think... But anyway, I think when you're a comedian, I think you probably grow up in a very secure situation. And maybe we didn't grow up with people with good listening skills. So, to have anybody listen, it really is a privilege, you know? So, I tried to give... I tried to be a as authentic as I can, and try to tell them hopefully a meaningful story to make a connection with people. But sometimes, it's hard because in 2019, my friend Brody, comedian guy, he killed himself hanging. My friend Brandon Iron, porn guy, killed himself hanging. And my dad killed himself by hanging. So, it was really, really hard to process the whole thing, you know? And I think a lot of times we use comedy to kind of talk very painfully. And I was not in a good place. Plus, 2019, I also turned 50. So, I think a lot of weird shit was happening. Thank God COVID hit. Because I think... I was able to stay one place for four months. Kind of process it. So, I think last four years since COVID, I changed my act a little bit. Like, I did French Fist last year. You know what the most difficult part for me as a comic? I think it's true. We wanted to... Look, in Japan, if you tell a funny joke and people don't laugh, we have to cure ourselves. So, um... So, when I tell stories, you want to tell funny stories and people get laugh, it's so difficult to tell a story as a comedian not to get laughed. That's the hard part. And sometimes when you tell these kind of personal stories, I think people can't hear it and they don't want to hear it. So, I think it's a good place for people to trust you. But believe me, it's not easy. This is more difficult than... Like, for Japanese, Bukkake film is more comfortable than saying, I love you and give somebody a hug. You know what I mean? Emotionally. It's so difficult. It's easy for Worshiner, but it's still lingering after 50 years. It's a little bit uncomfortable. And you know, we're both from Japan. The reason why we don't want to do it is not because we're dishonest. We feel like we're making our problem yours and it's really shameful and embarrassing. And that's something I have to overcome. So, on top of public speaking, which is scary too, I'm struggling with it. But sometimes after the show, when people say they really enjoyed it, and you're not a therapist, so they have somebody talk to you, that does give me a little bit of pleasure. I feel like, at least one out of 200 did something good. It did something good. That was a fantastic question. Thank you very, very much. No, no, no. I thought for a second you were going to ask me sarcastic. That's actually a really good question. Guys, this has been the show. Thank you very much. Thank you.",
