    "text": "Let me kick off with a question for Yoshi on this one. So you've worked in kind of like the whole aspect of the porn industry. If you have to think about which part you enjoyed the most, so from smuggling dirty magazines to selling porn to young gay boys to... Yeah. Looking for the right moment to whack on a videotape, which part was the one that you actually enjoyed the most? Maybe I'm not answering your question, but I was in jail one time. Which side of the bars? September 11. Wait. I'm sorry. 2003. All right. I was going up to Washington state because my cousin passed away and my dad passed away maybe a month before that. So I wasn't particularly in good mental state and I took the wrong bag. And remember when I stayed, I had a big circle because I bought a shoplift or whatever? So after that I got a collapsible baton, which is like a little stick when you go like this and become big. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well, because I had to go to a funeral, I took a wrong bag. At LAX, they found the bag with that weapon. Weirdly, that was classified like a felony level kind of thing versus if I had a handgun, they would have been okay. It wouldn't have been misdemeanor. So I ended up going to jail for like five or six days. In LA County, right? And it's really bad. because all the blacks in one corner, all the whites, all the Latino, and you know, Asians really don't commit a lot of crime, so I'm in the corner with me and a guy in a women's outfit and a Samoan guy. So it was a really, really bad situation. Only reason I didn't get hurt because I was wearing a butt man t-shirt or belladonna t-shirt. I can't remember what I was wearing. Anyway, one of the black guys said, hey, what did you get done? I work. As soon as they found out I work in porn,",
