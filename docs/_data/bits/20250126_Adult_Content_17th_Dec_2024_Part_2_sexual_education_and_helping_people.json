    "text": "I also like, I honestly, sometimes when people feel embarrassed, I tell them I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert, whatever. And people are afraid to ask this question. I had a client at the taboo. She was she's a Holocaust survivor. Her husband passed away. She never grew up in an environment. You could use that kind of language to say, I want you to touch me this way and that they never had that. And I think in my I know sounds like a really goofy thing to say, but I think happy sex and orgasm is a human right. I think it's a part of happiness, you know. But it wasn't that her husband was bad. She just they grew up in generation. You just never talk about these things. Right. Like even for most of the people here, especially younger. What does our parents will say? No kids, no kids, no kids for years. I'm a grandkid. What the fuck? Like you said, that's a huge leap, isn't it? So you need people like me because sometimes my friends, kids, people like sometimes my kids, when they were younger, email me. I heard you work with porn. I have a question. I don't know. I'm not afraid talking about it. I'm not. I don't I don't I don't know how to do women orgasm. And that's a problem. But I'm not afraid to talk to kids, but I'll still my friends kids like I don't mind talking to you, but I don't feel good about behind their back talking to you. So you should talk to your parents. And if you're afraid you get permission from your parents, you could talk to me because I don't want to. You know what I mean? I don't want to be a adult. I don't want to make anybody embarrassed. You know, that's why I make the most ridiculous person because a lot of people say, well, why would this person judge me? He's a scumbag at a porn shop. So you should talk to me. To help people was what really what really was fun.",
