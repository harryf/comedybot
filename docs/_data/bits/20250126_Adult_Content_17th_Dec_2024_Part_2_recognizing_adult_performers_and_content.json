One time, we were watching TV, right, with me and my friends. We had a commercial on. It's one of those dumb commercials where everybody's exercising or whatever, right? And I'm like, wow, did you see that? And they're like, what? They didn't see it. So you know those exercises where the girl lays flat, they raise their leg? Well, this one, they have a panty on, so as soon as she raise one leg, you can see one and a half lips. And like, I caught it. It's not like I'm not even there for like, not even like a second. Like, I caught it, right? Right? I can't play baseball, basketball, I don't have any, but stuff like that, I'm really good at catching. I'm really good at catching it for some reason. Like, there... This is how good I was. Um... It's like an icon. Imagine a recognition. Oh, that's... I mean, if you were to show me a guy from 2012 or earlier, I could usually tell whose dick that was. You know, because I've seen it so many times. Like, Eric Everhart, always bent to the left hand side, and you know, other ones that look like a triangle dick on top. I mean, you know, you just... I've seen it so many times, I don't remember, but, um, one time, this transgender girl, she used fake ID to work. So she had a fake ID that looked like 18. Couple years later, she started using her real ID, and she was like, oh, there's a discrepancy in birthdays, and of course, nobody noticed it. Of course, I remember, for some reason, I remember, like, I caught that kind of stuff. So, like, I was like, I don't know, I mean, we all have something we are good at, and that's what I was good at. I can't put IKEA shit together, but I could tell you, like, which tranny from which scene... It would be interesting if you had, like, a guidance counselor at school that was like, Yoshi, what do you grow up with? What do you want to be? I want to see vagina.",
