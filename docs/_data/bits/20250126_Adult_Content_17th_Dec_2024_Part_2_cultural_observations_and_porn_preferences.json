    "text": "Hell yeah. Like, you... See, see, as I see... Why is it hard if the tram goes the wrong way? How did you make me laugh so hard with that question? Like, like... In America, if the parent gives permission, kids could get married at a young age, provided they get permission from both parents, they could get married underage. So, if you could do that, and if the kid is dying, and it's just like, just because we feel uncomfortable, I think it's wrong to let them die. And if that's what they really want to do before they're dead, I think it's wrong not to do it. I think it's wrong to do that for them. It's coming from a good place, you know what I mean? Just because we feel uncomfortable... So you should let somebody suck his dick because he might suck the cancer out of him, right? You know what I'm saying? Is this wrong? It's a good thing he's not here because otherwise he would be like, I have cancer. And somebody asked me, how would you feel if your son is dying from cancer, and he's gay? This is the kind of father I am. The biggest pain is black gay cock for my son, right? I'll stretch my son's ass wide open. But you don't fuck my son, right? Because I'm homophobic. If my son's gay and dying, then I think that's only a good father would do that. Sorry, I think about this shit every fucking day. So you send your son... It's funny that I do this, but... If my shitty DNA gave my son cancer, I think that's the very least I should do. Any questions right now? Any questions from here? Yeah, please. We're recording this, this is why. So you said you went to many different countries, right? Like Sweden... Afghanistan... Yeah, yeah, check this. So do you see any countries that are more open? That are generally... That they have a culture that is... This is an excellent question. And based on all the places I have been to, in my personal opinion, women who are the most confident, and they're very honest, and they're assertive, and they have a happy sex life, in my opinion, I have to go into all those places, it's Dutch women. Because I notice most countries, I do... Hugo is Dutch. Oh! Yeah, I've never had a Dutch girlfriend. I'm not a Dutch woman. The reason why I find the Netherlands to be an amazing place, it's because most countries have one thing, but not both. So if prostitution is legal, porn is illegal. If porn is legal, prostitution is legal. Or worse scenario, they're both legal. But Netherlands have both of those things. I'm not suggesting having porn necessarily means a good thing, but what I think it is, you have a society where you give women the freedom to make a bad decision to do porn. See, more freedom, more choices for women is a better way. And because of the sex education in the Netherlands, that's one thing I noticed, they're very confident and assertive, you know, and I really like how parents approach sex, and like education, and with a lot of pragmatism, you know. But having said that, the country that really shocked me in terms of their aggressiveness, every time I talk to my porn guys, which particular regional country where women are contacted, for sex, it's really surprising, it's always India, Pakistan, and the Bangladesh area. I don't know why that is,",
