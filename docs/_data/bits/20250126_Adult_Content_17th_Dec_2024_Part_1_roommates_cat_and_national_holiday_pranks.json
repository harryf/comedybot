    "text": "You know, like, give me some of my, you get a little bit of an idea of my personality. Seven, eight years ago, my roommate, Rick, Irish-American guy, it's been his lifetime dream to go to Japan. So he went. So the only thing I have to do is take care of the apartment. And nothing happened to his cat, Juanito. Well, here's the thing. As I'm walking out of the apartment one night, and this is a couple of days away from Fourth of July National Holiday in the USA. Huge explosion. The goddamn thing. I saw the cat run an apartment. I lost the cat. And I really didn't know what to do. I mean, he's not married. He doesn't have a girlfriend. But this is his child, you know. So I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. And this is what Rick's mom said. Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son and you don't give him opportunity to look for the cat, he's going to resent you. So I think you should tell him that you lost the cat. So I thought about it. You know what? Rick's mom's right. So I emailed him. And because of time difference, he finally called me 14 hours later. Have you ever had a conversation with somebody who's been clearly been crying for a long time? That wasn't the funny part. Okay. Wow, that's the German audience. Okay. He goes, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat, but I got to say something here. Oh, my God. He's going to ask you to move out. He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat? So, I'm not Chinese. I'm from Japan. We're only our lord and savior. Hello, kitty. So anyway. So the next 14 days, I'm going crazy. Midnight, 3 a.m., 6, 9. You got it. Like every three hours. I'm walking around like a crazy lady in the neighborhood, shaking the cat food, saying, Juanito, looking for the goddamn cat. And it's getting closer and closer. And then within a couple of days, my friend's going to return. So I went to my friend, ADF. He has a very popular podcast at the time. He said, can I get on the pod, big people to help me look for the cat? So I went on. Please, if you live nearby Hollywood in Edgemont, if you want to volunteer to look for the cat, please help me. And better yet, if you find the cat, please contact me. And I'm like, okay. So I'm going to go to the cat food. I'm going to go to the cat food. This is where I made a mistake, because I live in the USA. I give my personal cell phone number on the podcast. So I think 70,000 people downloaded that week. After a couple hours, somebody texts me saying, Yoshi, I think I found your cat. I'm like, oh no! and I clicked the picture and it's a picture of a huge cock. Even after we found the cat, thank God when Rick drove in with his motorcycle, the goddamn cat reappeared. Everything's fine. But these motherfuckers will always text me their dick pictures on national holidays. So, you know, fall to July, Halloween, they will put pumpkin on top of his head. You know, Christmas, like a little bit of a Christmas ornament. And, you know, even on 9-11, they will put NYPD blue helmet on top of his dick. And of course, I salute. So there's something... There's something about my personality.",
