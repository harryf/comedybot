    "text": "So, this was like five, six years ago when my roommate, Irish-American guy, it's been his lifetime dream to go to Japan. So he went, and the only thing I have to do is make sure to take care of our apartment, and nothing happened to his cat, Juanito. Well, here's the problem. As well, I'm not getting out of the apartment. It's a couple days away from American Holiday for the Fourth of July, so there's a lot, so there's a huge firework. The goddamn cat rented an apartment, almost a cat. So here's my dilemma. What do I do? Do I contact Rick and ruin his vacation? Or, take a chance, hopefully, I can find a cat within the next fourteen days. And I really couldn't make a decision, so this is what Rick's mom said, Yoshi, if you end up not finding my son's cat, and you don't give him an opportunity to look for the cat, he's gonna resent you. So you tell him, and I thought about it, you know what? She's right. So, I emailed him, and because, you know, time difference between Japan and the U.S., he finally called me fourteen hours later. And, um, the way he talked, you could just tell, have you ever talked to someone and been crying for a long time? You could just hear him make a big stroke. He goes, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat, but I gotta say something here, that, oh my god. He's gonna ask him to move out. He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat? And, um, so, eat cat? I'm not, I'm not Chinese. Um, I was born and raised in Japan, you know. We don't need our lord and savior. Hello kitty. So anyway, um, that's our prayer. Anyway, so he basically said to me, please look for my cat, and, and, you know, every three hours, like a crazy person, like midnight, 3am, 6am, 9, noon, you know, I'm walking down the neighborhood, like a crazy person, just shaking the cat food, , and I can't find the cat. So, one of my friends, hey, why don't you go on ADF, Funny Comic in LA, do his podcast. So I went on his podcast, you know, begging people, like, hey, you know, if you wanna volunteer, look for the cat, I live in Hollywood in Ichiban, please contact me. And better yet, if you found the cat, please contact me. This is where I made a mistake. I think it's not a mistake in Switzerland, because the people are nice here. I made a mistake by giving my cell phone number on podcast. So what happened was, I think that like, within four hours of the podcast is released, I'm finding, getting like, text messages. And they said, Yoshi, Yoshi, I think I found your cat. So I clicked the picture, and it's a picture of huge cock. And I'm, so next four or five, I'm getting cock pictures, I mean, I'm getting dick pictures, right? I know you probably get dick pictures all the time. Oh, are you here? I'm glad you're here. Anyway, you know, I don't know why I say you when I'm talking about dick pictures. But anyway, so, you know, I'm getting dick, and even a couple days later, when my roommate finally showed up, what happened was, when he drove me with his motorcycle, the goddamn cat heard him. So whole three weeks when I was looking for it, it just stared at me, but doesn't, you know, I'm looking at this fucking cat for three weeks. Anyway,",
