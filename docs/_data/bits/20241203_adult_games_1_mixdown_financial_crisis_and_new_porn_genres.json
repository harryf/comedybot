And, fisting, I'm sure you guys know what that is? Uh-uh, it's a weird thing. Okay. Now, you can put anything on porn, you can put anything online, but as soon as you put it on VHS or DVD, you are judged by local community standards, so at the time, this is a law rule regarding fisting, fisting is legal as long as you don't put a thumb in there. Oh, really? No, that's law. How do you know? Okay, good question, but when my boss told me, because he's a lawyer, and he said he read the law, and here's the part I don't understand, because somebody had to make an argument and say, we make, you know what I mean, somebody had to make this law, how does it happen?

Here he, here he, you know, they use that, I don't know, English, a camera, and they had a debate, and somebody had to make a decision and say, you know, fisting is legal as long as you don't put a fucking thumb in there, so I don't know how these laws are made, but like, you know, when he told me, I was like, okay. Sometimes I hate them on first meet. So I asked my boss, well, what happened if a person's missing a thumb? Right? I mean, sometimes it's It's a good question. Yeah, because",
