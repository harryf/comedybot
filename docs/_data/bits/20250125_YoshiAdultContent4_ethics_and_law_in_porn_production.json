    "text": "so, I cannot okay this, right? So, I don't know what to do, so I call my colleague, seven of them, right? So, there's seven grown men standing in front of the TV, and, you know, I'm doing forward, reverse, forward, so like, this liquid's going out, in the asshole, out, in the asshole, go, go, go, go, go, go, you know what I mean? da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, right? And then we look, like, four people say, yay, four people say, nay, so like, you know, it's like Supreme Court decision, so we have to call our general manager, Chris, again, Mr. Thumb, and I don't know why, he can't stand, look, he had to stand like this, kinda look at me, look at that, you know, like that, and he goes, leave it, that's fine, right, so, that's my life with evil angel, nine years, right, like, and, um, and, my, my expertise was transgender porn, and, here's the thing, ladies, if you show me dicks, like, 2012 and earlier, 95% probability that I know whose dick that is, if you show me dicks, I'm gonna beat you guys down. Yeah, you know, assholes, about 80%, you know what I mean, like, uh, right, so, and that's why I ended up doing transgender porn, because, here's the problem with transgender porn, not that, being transgender, but, these fucking people, so they would take passport pictures, looking like a regular guy with no makeup, but in a movie, they put so much makeup, I have, you know, I, I match the, there's like five or six scenes with five or six different transgender people, and I have a five different paperwork, and a lot of times they film shit in Brazil, so, already copies are bad, it's in Portuguese, I don't read the language, so I gotta fucking match, right, and they pick, so, I mean, it's like CSI Van Nuys, right, like, um, like, sometimes, oh, okay, this person tattooed, so I could match with that, tattooed, right, so, it's like a lot of fucking puzzle, right, and, um, so, I had to do that, and, um, one time, I caught it, I mean, I'm completely useless, but one time, I noticed something with ID, this is how blue my eyes were, this transgender person filmed movies underage, she had a fake ID, so when she turned 18, she used her correct ID, so obviously you have this person with two different birthdays, but nobody noticed it except fucking Mr. Pervert over here, because I'm not really good at anything, um, but, this is how good my eyes, I don't have a good eye vision, but when it comes to perverted things, my eyes are pretty good, um, one time I was watching a commercial, they had a commercial, gym commercial, right, people are exercising, join this gym now, you know, 50 Swiss, whatever, per month, whatever, and, and, um, I goes, oh my god, did you see it, my friend, none of them caught it, so, split second, when this girl was, you know, I don't know what you call it, she was laying flat in this exercise, and you know when she raised one leg up really high, you know what I'm talking about, it's one of those leg exercises, because she wore shorts when she raised her leg, because she didn't have panties on, you could see one of the pussy lips, and it was like half a second, and my eye caught it, I don't have x-ray vision, well I have triple x-ray vision, but um, so, you know, you guys are good at programming and do other shit, so this is what I do, now, should I keep going or you guys are still okay? I'll give it 10 more. Okay. Um, so I, I think, um, I think, um, people ask me, Yoshi, why, why is it called adult content? Right? I misunderstood. Um, I, when I was a kid, when I heard adult content, I thought it meant adult content, like adult happiness. That's what I thought. And here's the thing, whether you work in porn shops, whether it's people that, really, believe me, if you ended up working for a guy named Buttman, you made some bad decisions in your life, right? I worked for Buttman. I worked for Evil Angel. So when people ask my family, where does your son work, you know what my family say? Since it's called Evil Angel, my family always told everyone, my son worked for a company called EA. Which is a video game company called Electronic Arts, and believe me, we have joystick, but different kind of joystick, so anyway. So they're very embarrassed, I'm not embarrassed. I don't care. But people who work behind a counter, customers who buy porn, people who are performing front and back, I gotta tell you, it has nothing to do with perversity, in my opinion. I think a lot of people are just fucking lonely. Like anybody who works in porn, believe me, there's not too many people who fuck in front of camera, come from really, really close knit family. Maybe Europeans, because you guys are not that rich. You guys are not that religious, there's no shame, but for Americans who do porn, there's a lot of shame. So you really have to cross the line to put yourself like an outsider. But in Europe, like, Rocco Cervetti, Nacho Vidal, who I also work, Manuel Ferreira from France, all these people, there's no shame in Europe, really, you know, like, because Americans, Americans love violence over sex. You guys like sex over violence, you know what I mean? So, if you're doing porn, you probably came from a very difficult situation, right? Like, you know, my mom said she wanted to kill herself every time she sees me. I mean, she laughed when she was like, dick. Alright, so, so I think I got fired from a job 2012, and I've been traveling the last 12 years all over the world, relating to anything related to sex. Like, when I went to Afghanistan, three times, on the first day, I found right away, you could find prostitutes in Afghanistan, did you know that? I found it right away within",
