I don't have any trans jokes tonight. How many of you guys are Swiss here, by the way? Oh, we do have some Swiss people. Very nice. And, you know, you're in the minority, of course. It's nice to be reminded you're a minority. I'm actually, as Teddy said, I'm actually half English, half German. Which is funny, because normally when I tell people that, I have this joke, I go like, that means I want to take over the world. But I'm too polite to do it. For one time, actually, I was travelling in India and I did that joke. And they were like, yes, Germans. Very polite people. Excellent history knowledge. Do you have any Germans here? Okay, that's a great . I like the way she did the bag. She grabbed it off and take it down. Are you Frenchman as well? Where are you from? Let me see. Can I ask? Yes, you've got a Frenchman there. I don't know if you know the German. Croatia. You're from Croatia? Yes. Okay, this is an interesting cluster of a nation that goes. Yes. I've got a German friend. No, no , no, no. Consort, where is face. No, bring it on back, I don't know. All right, this is an interesting structure. All right, last question.",
