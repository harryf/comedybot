    "text": "I didn't know what to do, because I went in not knowing anything, and I just learned really hard way, you know? Because, um, you're great because, um, really, I say this with sincerity, I have two friends, Ogi Ogas and Asai Gadam, they wrote a book called A Billion Ways of Thought, and it's a book, it's such an amazing book, because it was written like 12, 13 years ago, when, back then they had access to, uh, online search, and many of the search engines gave all the information. So, because traditional sex studies, you usually study somebody within your local, right? Like students, but if you only do research on students, it's not a very good sample. You wanna, you wanna have, because all you're doing, especially like 50s like with Kinsey and Master Johnson, you're only doing, uh, studies on like white, Anglo-Saxon group, but to truly give a big picture of how people really behave, there's only one area where people are completely honest, and you have a billion search, which is internet. And back then, when, uh, my friend Ogi did the research, it's illegal now, but he literally had billions and billions of internet search. Now, if I pick individually, I can't tell you what you're into, but if you have a billions of search, you did, you know there's a pattern that certain things are true, whether you're in Africa, Middle East, and Asia, right? So, um, so, but, he cannot no longer do study because his wife is a doctor from Saudi Arabia, they're just so embarrassed because they'd rather you do cognitive study about violence. That's normal. But as soon as you do sex, they're gonna call you fucking pervert, scumbag, and things like that, but honestly, you know, you live in an amazing place. Zurich, you have, was it Iceland? I was living in one of the cities, right? Think about all the discoveries in biology, chemistry, and physics in the last 124 years. Unbelievable. You know the answer, not a whole lot of discoveries take so long because people are still embarrassed talking about it. So it takes someone like you, somebody with a social background, and ethical pervert myself. Right? You know, you need an ethical pervert like myself because some of the greatest terrible things happen in this world, because you know, I've been to every one of those Jeffrey Epstein cases. I've been to all of them. So, um, I went, um, so we're working at the porn shop, you know, like, I don't know how you would have handled it, but sometimes I have people walking, a lady walked in one time and was like, I fucked my son. She says this, right? She fucking walked out. Like, lady, you didn't even buy anything. That's pretty heavy. You know what I mean? It's my first night. Another guy comes, I fucked my stepdaughter, whatever. Like, I think, I don't know, I know that people have therapists, but this is kind of a little bit weird. Like, how do you tell them you have a certain finish? I don't think even they're kind of comfortable with that, right? So I didn't know sitting there, people are dumping the shit on me. Literally, right? So, um, you know, I, I, I, figuratively, figuratively, yes, but, um, or literally, I don't know, you tell me. . . . . like brian i don't i don't i don't feel comfortable um you know what i mean like i don't i don't feel comfortable doing this and and then yes you please like because because he he brought people right so he had to pay them no matter if they do sing on that so he's in the top so it's like three four thousand dollar scene it's like all right so like um um i don't know this is like 15 years ago so they're like i don't know five and eight years old like oh my god what i'm gonna do so i took them to mcdonald and and then um okay happy or something i don't know what to say to them i thought i talked to sex work but i don't know so anyway i was really uh uncomfortable because um the oldest girl was drinking vanilla milkshake and she broke and all the vanilla shake hit her face which is weird because her mom's doing the exact same thing and she's like oh my god i'm so sorry i didn't know that i was gonna do that and she's like oh my god i don't know why i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i didn't know that i was gonna do that same thing as uh as i speak right i mean i'm talking to me because i have i have to reconcile with two different ideas i have to be nice to the kid but like i'm a comedian and i'm working porn like yeah it's really really uncomfortable now that's not the part i was talking about so i've talked to chief and scene so i've talked to chief and scene she took a channel showed up pick up the kid i have to go um where they're filming that stuff so brandon having sex with a girl and afterwards there's like 25 30 guys you know it's like uh buccanti whatever and and so every time something like that happened you know there's a big puddle in the middle of the room right right somebody had to clean that you're looking at that guy so my job is two things i have to do two two five seven which is um um i'm sure i think i think you guys are way too young but in 1985 there was an incident in america there was a young woman named tracy lord one of the greatest performer and a famous porn star her late real name is norma coosman from ohio she was under age at the time she she had a bunch of fake ids she did a film and then ever since then to protect young people from from during porn, we have this thing called 2257 where you have to show two IDs to prove that you're 18 years older. So my job is to show up after the blow bang scene to make sure that they're 18 years old, which is fine. I just don't like after the thing, these guys might shake my hand. I don't want to fucking shake your hand. Go away, right? So as soon as I check that 2257, they're 18, they get the paycheck, they're paid. Okay, after I'm done, I have to do the cleanup. This is how dumb I am. I thought, because it's just like all this fucking liquid, you know, that if I were to really hide boots, I'm away from the problem, right?",
