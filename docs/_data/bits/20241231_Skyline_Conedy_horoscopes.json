Like, make some noise if you believe in horoscopes. Horoscopes? Okay. Clearly a lot of shitty star signs in this room. No, because me, I'm a Leo. Greatest fucking star sign of all. Tom, are you a Leo? No. Did I take back the brofist? Look, I think it's, you know, you're like everywhere too smart for horoscopes. I don't think the problem with horoscopes is that they seem stupid. I think it's because they're too generic, aren't they? Right. Like, if you read your horoscope on YouTube. You're gonna read horoscopes on your phone. It'll just say something like, like, today you will have a productive day. Like, that was just written by a chat GPT. Fuck yeah. Yeah, but I think the answer is we need to make horoscopes much more specific. Like, just imagine if you read your horoscope on your phone, it says, today you will be fucked by a horse. What the fuck? Yeah. And then if you're a boomer like me, you're gonna be fucked by a horse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. happened to you sir? Oh I was just walking down the street sir. This fucking horse comes out of nowhere. And so Trevor your accent is really Scottish and Irish at the same time. And so how the fuck do you think you sound if you've just been fucked by a horse? Anyway guys that's me wrapping up with my message of hope, whatever happens I'm pretty sure no one here will get fucked by a horse. Bye!",
