I don't know why that is, but they're really, really aggressive, you know? You just said they make... You just said something like, make a bad decision if women go into porn. Do you think it's a bad decision for women to go into porn? No, um... When I got into business, Canada wasn't a big thing, so I knew a lot of my friends were from Eastern Europe. You know, thinking back then was, they would film stuff in the States, the chance of them getting copies in Eastern Europe, highly unlikely, they come from very poor countries after the post-Cold War, so this was like once-in-life generational wealth for a lot of them. So once from the early 90s, they made so much money that they were able to go back to Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, and that money really changed their life for their families for the generations to come. So in situations like that, I think it's great, but I think when I see American girls, it's, yes, sometimes it's a money thing, but it's more complicated than that. And two, once you do porn, as you know, you can never go back, like people see you, but you know how difficult it is? Imagine you're 18, and you're not planning to go to school to become a dentist, or whatever, you're an engineer, and you're making $1,500, $2,000 per scene, and three years later, you quit. You honestly think you could go work at Starbucks at $8 an hour? This is a very, very difficult thing. A lot of these girls worked for like three, four, five, six years back then, and they fucking never paid taxes. Uncle Simon won their money, so they're getting in a bit of a financial situation. I got an argument with people running the porn industry, like there should be a retirement plan, post-porn programs to help them transition into, you know, unless they marry a rich guy, so I was really concerned for them, but it's it's a difficult and now, with the OnlyFans and Instagram, it's a completely different business. It's hard for me to understand that new business, because they're not really porno. Like, I'm so old school, like, they don't really love what they do. They're attention whores, and I just want whore. You know what I mean? Oh, wow.",
