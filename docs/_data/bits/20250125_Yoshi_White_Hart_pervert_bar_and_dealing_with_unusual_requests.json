    "text": "I have to deal with, but, um... So, prior to that, I was working at Taboo Video Store in downtown LA, you know, and, um... Oh, God, this is a rough one. All right. So... You know how you go to Apple Store, you have a genius bar? So, when you go to Taboo Video Store, you have a pervert bar. So, I'm the in-house pervert, right? So, I'm there to help any, you know, people with the problems. And I have to be delicate. I have to be very, very delicate, you know, because there's some things even you don't want to talk to a therapist about, you know. And, um... So, here, a couple of stories. I don't... And, by the way, thank you very much. You paid your... I know you're working really hard and you spent a valuable time. So, I appreciate it. And, um... I hope I'm not grossing out with God, but, you know, a couple more then, I'll... God, I feel like this is like a hostage situation. Anyway... So, I remember the guy walk in, right? And, um... It's like, oh, I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. It's like one in the morning in Seattle. There's so much snow, I think, like, oh, my God. I'm working midnight until like the 9 AM shift. And, like, I know what's gonna come. And I think 2 AM, this gentleman walked in. Just good looking guy. Really well dressed. And, um... Not a typical customer at a porn store, like, in the late 90s. He went in. I said, hello, how are you? Quiet. Um... So, I thought, oh, maybe he's shy. No, I can't force it. Just leave him alone, you know. He checked out the movie section. And after a while... He got a new song. Oh! No, he probably had, like, his assistant pick it up or something, you know. But, um, he's such a scumbag. Um... I hate that guy. No, no, seriously. Look, fire happened in California. But a lot to do with resource mismanagement, allocation problem, things like that. So, people losing their shit. So, yeah, I'm gonna punch that fucker in the face. Um, I hate him. And I don't think... I'll go back to this one. But, you know, this powerful motherfucker. And, um... Did you watch the recent Joe Rogan episode? He finally interviewed an alien. Well, I call him an alien, but you might call him Mark Zuckerberg. He's a fucking elite. You know, they're fucking scumbags. And, um... Oh, my god. Because I'm... I'm here until next week because I'm going to the World Economic Forum. And, uh, I'll go back to the show. But I'm really fascinated because I think these powerful people hurting good regular people. And, uh, I think it's a lot to do with they have a terrible fantasy and sexual problems. You know, like... I mean, why... I'm trying to be delicate, but why rape one person when you could fire 10,000 people for your company? That's how they get off on it. Because when super rich people don't have a satisfying sex life, they fuck the poor. Believe me. This is true in UK and America, right? So, that's why I'm kind of obsessed with the kind of these, um, all these sex stories. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Now, you know what I mean. In the, um... No, I don't mean it like that. I'm an ethical pervert. And I mean, it takes one to know one, right? So, um... I live in LA. I've met a lot of, like, sex workers. Through them, I meet all kinds of politicians doing all kinds of weird shit. Billionaires and people like that. Believe me. Um, you know, they're real motherfuckers. Um... So, this guy come in. He said, he finally said, hey, could you help me find a movie? Of course. That's my job. So, I asked him, do you have the porn star's name? Um, do you have the fetish, company? And everybody says no. So, I tell him, sir, you know, we have about 11,000 titles. I don't know how to help you. He said, well, you gotta help me find my daughter. So, yeah. I kind of laughed, too. Because I, I, this is honest. I thought, okay, he heard he started doing porn. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. And I was like, well, he's a pro. And he's a pro. And he's a pro at doing porn. He needs evidence to kind of confront her. That's what I thought, right? Boy, I wish that was the case. You know what happened? His daughter died in a car accident six months before. Oh. And about 11 month, maybe a year before, when she was in college, Girls' Night, they went to a local strip club. I don't know if you do that in London, but this is kind of common in America. Like, young girls, Girls' Night, they go to a strip club, have a fun time. And they just happened to be filming a porn movie in there. And she just happened to be the audience member. Yeah. And she just happened to be, um, a porn star. Uh-huh. in there and she just happened to be the audience member. And this is like his daughter's last live footage. So he's visiting from Canada, right? So I mean, I'm a pervert, but I'm not a monster. I want to help him find it. But let's be honest, I don't have the title, nothing like that. And just like, even if you have it, there's fucking 11,000 titles. I only have another five hours to find the goddamn thing. But I want to help the guy, you know? So I'm making educated guess, taking all the movie, going fast forward, you know, like if you have a three VCR, I'm going fast forward, but it's just three at a time. And every time customer coming and they're buying butt plug, I have to stop, get the cash back. I'm panicking because I'm not finding, you know, assuming we have him, I'm gonna help this guy. I don't know what to do. So I'm panicking. So I find it at 16. At 6 a.m. I call one of the number one customer shopping, you know, Glenn. I call him like a perverted Yoda. And I call them and I said, here's, so he's very upset because he told his wife, a fucking liar, that he doesn't watch porno anymore. He, Glenn, watch a lot of porn, right? So he was mad at me, but last second, I told him what happened, what's going on. So he understood, like he has a daughter too. So he said, did you check this ABCD section? Like, yeah, I'm not an idiot. And he finally said, did you check the gay and bisexual section? I said, Glenn, I'm looking for a heterosexual girl. He goes, you don't understand, many of the strippers, gay men dancing for women. I didn't know that was pretty new at that business at the time. So, okay, thanks. So I went. I went to the gay section, I picked a couple of 30 or 40, and within 45 minutes, we found her in a fucking video. And I was like, what? And she was like, no. I wish I was a good person for doing that, but I gave her the tape and she got that shit solved. And it's nice to do that, but there's other times, this guy come in, he's like, could you help me? Joyce, I know that one. If I need to get up, just let me know. Okay? Okay. But there's times I have to help people, right? This guy come in and say, hey, do you have some kind of chemical for my girlfriend? What do you need? Like, perfume, all that? And he's trying to be delicate, and I'm not trying to be offensive, but she has a particular smell down there, and it's hard for him to go down there, but he doesn't want to tell her because it's going to hurt her feelings. So he's suffering. He's suffering in silence. But he want to make sure she know without hurting her feelings. So I say, oh, so you want to make sure she know without telling her and not hurting her feelings. Okay. Listen to Uncle Yoshi. This is what you do. You get two fingers, just while you're having consented sex, just jam it in her vagina for a long time. And when you do it for a long time, hold it out until you have a long, thick liquid across. Damn. I'm going to have to do this. You put it in her mouth, then she knows. Okay. Chimo, quickly knock it off, okay? Would you agree if you have a good intention when you want to help somebody, sometimes you have unconventional \u2013 so, you know, you live the lie. You know, sometimes you have perfect solutions, you want to help, but you know, you're a young guy, you'll find out. You don't always have perfect solutions. You know, most Japanese are Buddhist, and we don't help homeless people and stuff because we believe in reincarnation.",
