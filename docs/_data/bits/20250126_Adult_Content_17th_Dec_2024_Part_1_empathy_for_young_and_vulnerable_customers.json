    "text": "Because, you know, you've got to remember, this is like late 90s. It's not like people go online, Reddit or something, and ask for help. There wasn't a whole lot. So you have to go to a porn shop, and especially in small towns, porn shops are really like embassy. In small towns, especially like gay kids. Because there's really not a place to go. You're always not able to trust people. So young gay kids, everyday kids are turning 18. And imagine you come from a community, you can't talk about this thing. You need help. And you want to talk to somebody without them making you feel bad. And sadly, for a long time, this is absolutely true, the places for gay young people to meet is porn shops, if they don't have gay bars. Because it can be very dangerous. So I'm cognitive about that. So I want to be a bit more sensitive. I remember this kid walking, Sir, could you help me find really good gay porn? Here's the thing. I don't watch gay porn, but I read just enough reviews. Because you don't want to say, Oh, this fucking suit, who watches that? You know, you don't want to do that. So I read reviews. So I said, well, I highly recommend these brands. There's Balcom, Mustin, Bellamy. These are top of the line. In fact, this one, Jeff Strakker, Jeff Strakker. He just won ABN Gay Award. He got, on this one, he got five dicks out of five dicks. So I highly recommend this one. Now, if you like chunky guys, bears, I recommend this one. You know, so like, you know, you get a movie, you don't want to make them feel bad, right? This is how different the kids are 25 years ago. So this kid, very nice, thankful. He returned next day, the tape, right? And I'm sure you guys say sushi before, right? Obviously. And you know that little ginger shit in his eye? That's, you know, the reason you have that is because every time you have a savoriness, you want to try and make sushi, you take that little radish thing, kind of wipe out, cleanse it, enjoy the next sushi. Well, he did a typical thing where I think he felt guilty. He was guilty that he watched gay porn. So what he did was he brought, he tried to read four heterosexual tapes to cleanse the gayness from that night before. And don't get me wrong, I make commissions, I'm okay, but I told him like, look, if you really want to watch this, that's fine, but you should feel guilty. Because, you know, when you grow up in Japan, we don't have this thing where like, Judeo-Christian where you should be ashamed gay. We don't, you know, I mean, we think it's silly. But it's not shameful, you know. You know, you're not supposed to put that there, you know. So, you know what he told me? I just don't want my parents to think I'm gay because they think they didn't raise me right. And I told him like, no, no, no. If anything, you conduct yourself in such a polite, wonderful manner. I think your parents did well. And you shouldn't feel guilty about this. This is who you are. You're going to meet plenty of people in your life who's going to love you. And I think it's okay.",
