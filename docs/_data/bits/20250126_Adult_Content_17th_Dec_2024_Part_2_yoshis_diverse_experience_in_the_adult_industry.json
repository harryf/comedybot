    "text": "Let me kick off with a question for Yoshi on this one. So you've worked in kind of like the whole aspect of the porn industry. If you have to think about which part you enjoyed the most, so from smuggling dirty magazines to selling porn to young gay boys to... Yeah. Looking for the right moment to whack on a videotape, which part was the one that you actually enjoyed the most? Maybe I'm not answering your question, but I was in jail one time. Which side of the bars? September 11. Wait. I'm sorry. 2003. All right. I was going up to Washington State because my cousin passed away and my dad passed away maybe a month before that. So I wasn't particularly in a good mental state and I took the wrong bag. And remember when I stayed I had a big circle because I bought a shoplifter or whatever? So after that I got a collapsible baton, which is like a little stick when you go like this and become big. Well, I can't remember. I don't remember. I gotta teach you some information. Just to give you some hints. Anyway, it was a reallyribble society. We had no pantyhose on. It was in the school\u00f3washande questo. That's true. Does it still happen now? No, it hasn't. It's really bad because all the blacks in one corner, all the whites, all the Latinos, and you know, Asians really don't commit a lot of crimes. So I'm in the corner with me and a guy in a women's outfit and a Samoan guy. So it was a really, really bad situation. Only reason I didn't get hurt because I was wearing a Buttman t-shirt or Belladonna t-shirt. I can't remember what I was wearing. Anyway, one of the black guys said, hey, what did you get done? I work.",
