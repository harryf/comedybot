    "text": "For two weeks. Right? I mean, I'm not a zoologist. That's not cool. And, uh, I'm not a zoologist. I'm a zoologist. But I'm a zoologist. And I'm a zoologist. I'm a zoologist. So, um, so I went back to the podcast, and please, we found a cat. Could you, could you not send me the pictures any more? Right? And I, I don't know, I don't know what it, there's something about my personality, you know. Like, growing up, um, you'll figure out later on, but like, um, people always show me their dicks for some reason. So... So this particular guy, I don't know, you know. He's like, oh, I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know, you know, he'll always send me his dick pictures on national holidays. Okay, okay, Halloween's not a national holiday, but he'll put a picture of like a, he'll put a pumpkin on top of his head and take a picture of that. He'll put an outfit on his dick on Christmas, you know, like a Santa Claus outfit. And you know, not cool, but he'll take a picture of 9-11 and he'll put NYPD blue helmet on. Of course I would do the same to English people, but like you fucking salute that dick. So anyway, yeah, weird. So there's obviously something about me and I think a lot of times, it's more like my misunderstanding situation or a very uncomfortable situation, right? I don't know if you know this, here's a good example when I'm having a problem with my family. You know this thing called reverse culture shock? Like I was born in Japan, live in the West so long, when I go back, you know, I'm more westernized. So like, I'm kind of like, you know, like a IBM PC computer, but my operating system is like Apple now. So when I go back to Japan, like, I'm confused, like, I have to explain to them, but they don't believe me, like early 70s in Japan, there was a group of Americans living in Japan. They want to celebrate Christmas, and they want to eat turkeys, and turkeys are not indigenous animal of Japan. So all those Americans ate chicken for Christmas when the Japanese people thought, oh, I guess that's what you're supposed to do. Around the same time, KFC was expanding their franchise in Japan, and I didn't know that. You know what I mean? I was going to go to their franchise in Japan, and I was like, I don't even know if I'm going to go to their franchise in Japan. I'm going to go there. And I'm like, you know what? I'm going to go there. And I'm like, I'm going to go there. And I'm going to go to their franchise in Japan. And, I don't know if you know this, every KFC in Japan have life-size statue of Colonel Sanders. I don't know why, but they just have them like that? Well, that year, some joker put Santa Claus outfit on Colonel Sanders. So a lot of Japanese people think KFC and Colonel Sanders have something to do with Christmas. So every Christmas in Japan, if you want to eat KFC for Christmas, you have to make a reservation like three months ahead. Okay, here's the weird part. I have to explain what's going on. And this makes me really uncomfortable because I don't want to disrespect religious people. So quite often times, they will crucify Colonel Sanders on the cross. I shouldn't be laughing, but they put a nail on Colonel Sanders. You don't see blood, you see gravy. Or another time, they've crucified Santa Claus, right? So why am I the representative of Christianity? Can you not crucify Santa Claus, Colonel Sanders? Yeah, that's uncomfortable. So pretty much, that's the kind of stuff I have to deal with. I was born in eastern part of Japan. And do you guys remember about 2011, there was earthquake, tsunami. It just devastated eastern part of Japan. And thank God all my family survived. But it was so powerful, the wave hitting eastern part of Japan. Many of the building parts, you know, buildings, cars, and ships, all this debris, flowed away from Japan. In fact, many of this debris flowed across Pacific Ocean. And it was a big expansion at western United States. You know, it took sometimes 2, 3, 4, 5, sometimes even 6, 7 years, to hit the western part of Japan. It's kind of incredible, all this debris crossing the Pacific Ocean, hit Japan. Hit California, Oregon, Washington. I'm telling you because I finally saw my grandmother last week. And... Sorry, I think that's really funny, but I'll get rid of it. That's what comedy is. You know what's interesting? When people... I apologize, it's not funny. But when they have found bloated people after the tsunami, they get really large, right? And I should be delicate about it, but they get so large, they look like whales at the beach. You know, when the whales are stuck. I know I would have the answer, but the Japanese have a very complicated route. They're like, what's the relationship? Whales? We... Sorry. I think only Norwegian Japanese people, we...whales, you know? By the way, did you know that we're Godzilla? It's a Japanese word, Gojira. Which is a combination word... Gorilla and Kujira, which is whale. So Godzilla is basically water breathing whales. Sorry, it's useless information. But anyway... But when my American friends found out that I eat whales, they get really, really upset. Because, you know, I think just like UK, they're very environmentally friendly and Japanese are not. I just want to make clear to my American friends. So let me get this straight. In America, it's not okay to eat whales, but it's okay to look like one. By the way, like 40% of Americans are obese and Japan is about 3 to 4%, you know? So... We can't...we're, I guess, healthier.",
