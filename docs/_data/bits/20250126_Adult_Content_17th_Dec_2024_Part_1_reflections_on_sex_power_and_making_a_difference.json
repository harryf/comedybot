    "text": "Cheers. Cheers, man. Cheers. What's up? Boycott Coca-Cola is not good for fun stuff, bro. I'll finish with saying this. I've been to 70 countries. It really pains me to see people suffer because they're poor. And they suffer because, I think... I think... I think when people suffer... You know when rich people don't have a satisfying sex life, you know what I think they do? They fuck the poor. And the poor, they fuck them really well. And Bernie Maeda, who I went to his house in a court case, and he said something... I can't remember exactly the phrase, but I read between the lines. I mean, why rape one girl when you could fire 10,000 people and you fuck those people and their families, right? And these people get off on that. So, what I'm trying to do is trying to do these talks to help people like... If you change sex, people can talk about it. And if these powerful people are having problems with sex, they're gonna cause so much more problems. So, if you wanna know what's going on in the war room, check out what's going on in the bedroom. You wanna know what's going on in the war room, check in the bedroom. So, I think... I know people call me a pervert, but I think I'm an ethical pervert. And... And I'm trying to make the world better. I'm trying to make the world a better place. And believe me, if you're dealing with a pervert, sometimes it takes another pervert to make a better world. Alright, thank you very much. I hope I didn't make you tired.",
