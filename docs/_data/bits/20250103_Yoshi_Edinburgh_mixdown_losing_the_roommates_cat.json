    "text": "So, about eight years ago... My roommate, Rick, Irish American guy, he went to Japan to spend his lifetime dream to go there. So, only thing I have to do is take care of his apartment. And most importantly, nothing happened to his cat, Juanito. So, as I'm taking two garbage bags out of the apartment, and it's two days before Fourth of July, American National Holiday, there's a huge explosion. And the cat panicked just ran out of the apartment. And I chased the cat for three blocks. And I lost the cat. Also, neighbors didn't like it. They don't want to see Asian person chasing a cat. You know, it's not a... Cats and dogs, beware. Anyway, so I didn't know what to do. Disclaimer, five years before that, when Rick went to Australia, I wasn't living with him at the time. But five years ago, when he went to Australia, his other cat passed away. So, two trips, one died, one disappeared. So, I don't know what to do. You know, what should I do? Do I contact Rick and ruin his vacation? Or... Take a chance. Hopefully, I can find a cat within the next 14 days. Now, see, you're telling people brave. But I couldn't make a decision. So, I went to emergency list. And the first one is Rick's mother. So, I called her. And that's what she said. You know, Yoshi, if you ended up not finding my son's cat, and you don't give my son opportunity to look for the cat, he's going to be very angry with you. So, I think you should tell him. And I thought about it. I think she's right. So, I emailed him because of the time difference. He finally called me 14 hours later. When I talked to him, have you ever had a conversation with someone who's been crying for a long time? I could just hear in his voice that he's been crying a long time. And he said, Yoshi, I know you didn't mean to lose my cat, but I got to say something here. I thought, oh my God, he's going to ask me to move out. He goes, Yoshi, did you eat my cat? So, eat cat? I'm not Chinese, you know, right? I'm from Japan. We don't eat our Lord. We don't eat our Lord and Savior. Hello kitty. So, we do it like this. Anyway, he just said, please, just look for my cat. You know, just do your best your ability. So, from next day, midnight, 3 a.m., 6 a.m., 9 a.m., you know, every three hours, like a crazy person, I'll just walk around the neighborhood shaking cat's food and say, Juanito, for one day, three days, a week, 10 days, I can't find a cat. And I'm really getting nervous. So, I call my friend, Eddie F. At the time, he has a very popular podcast called Talking Shit. So, I went on pod and I beg people, like, hey, if you find a cat, please contact me. Or if you want to volunteer and help me look for the cat, please contact me. Here's where I made my mistake. I give my personal cell phone number on the podcast. So, between 25 to 50,000 people have my cell phone number in Los Angeles. All over the world. So, I think two hours after the pod was released, a guy text me and said, hey, Yoshi, I think I found your cat. I clicked the picture. It's a picture of a huge cock. And so, there's something about me. People want to show me their dicks to me, right? I don't know. Not pussy, no vagina, no breasts. People always want to show me their dicks from, you know, all my life. So, like, I told him, please stop sending me those pictures. But three days later, when Rich drove back, from an airport in motorcycle, Juanito just reappeared. See, he was around the whole time. Even though I've been calling Juanito this fucking piece of shit, just watch me and not do anything. So, when Rick showed up, I went back to the pod and said, thank you for helping me, but please no more dick pictures.",
