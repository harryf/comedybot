    "text": "So. So tomorrow I'm going to France. I'm going to Nice. And I made a mistake. I should have gone to Marseille. And the reason I'm going to France tomorrow is because... Have you guys heard about this Mazon rape case? Her name is Gisele Petticoat. So anyway, her... Her husband, the last 10 years, 10, 11 years, is now his wife, Al. A whole bunch of men have sex with her. Filmed this thing. And then, I'm going there as a technical advisor. Now, I'm... I'm kidding. No. I'm going there, it's because... You know, one time I was talking to my boss, John Stelliano. John, why is it in Amsterdam, in the red-light district, how come there's a porn shop? I mean, people have sex with... prostitutes. Why would you get a porno? It doesn't make any sense. And John said something really interesting. He said, because, Yoshi, you could buy a piece of fantasy and you could take it with you. You could have sex with her, that's it. But when you have this physical copy of porn, you could keep running the fantasy over and over in your head. And I gotta admit, even after I got fired from Evo Angel 12 years ago, that had a huge impact. So, I'm one of those weird people. I was one of the four people in the room when Ghislaine Maxwell found guilty verdict. She was an associate with Jeffrey Epstein. I went to the Trumps case, Danny Masterson, Harvey Weinstein, SBF, Elizabeth Holmes. So I've been going to a lot of the cases like this. I even went to Davos last year. And you know how Davos every year, I'm sure you guys follow, I'm sure some of you were planning, you know, they have all of those, you know, all of those stupid retarded ideas every year. Like sustainability was like two years ago. And then I guess this year was AI or whatnot. Do you really want to know this? Are you familiar with the World Economic Forum in Davos, I'm sure? Yes. Okay. So if you don't know, basically some of the most wealthiest, most powerful, connected people meet in Davos, Switzerland, four days every January, talk about how to solve the world's problem. Never mind these people that want to cause the problem to begin with. Don't listen to them. This is my solution to you. You really want to know how these people think? Because this is what I did when I was there last year. I talked to all the sex workers who were servicing them that we, you learn everything you need to know about these people, the way they fuck people and how they abuse these girls. Let me tell you. So, so, sorry. I hope something is like a TED talk. It's not funny anymore. But I've been going through these things because I'm...",
