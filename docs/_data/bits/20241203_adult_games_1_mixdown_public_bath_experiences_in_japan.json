    "text": "I remember while our home in Japan had a problem with our water and heating, so my dad decided to take me and my younger brother to public bath. It's kind of common, but I grew up, like, taking bath at home, and if you're young enough, you could, if you're like 6 or 7 years or younger, you could with your mom, public bath, and with your dad, you know, because it's separate by gender. But I remember going first time with my dad, and because I went with my dad, so men, because I'm like, hi, I'm at the dick angle, so as soon as I walk into the public bath, you know, dicks are coming at my face. And when I went with a female, you know, I have a fear of like, showering, so I just do a little bit of nerdy, but in Japan, if you're afraid of soap, they put this plastic kind of thing around your head, wash your hair so you don't get your... Anyway, one time my cousin came up, put a soap on my face, and I panicked and ran, and I'm running across with a soap on my face, and, you know, I ran into a vagina. So, at 5 or 6, you know, I got pussy in my mouth.",
