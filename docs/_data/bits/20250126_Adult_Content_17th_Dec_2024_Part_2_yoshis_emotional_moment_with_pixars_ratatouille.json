It reminded him childhood memory of his dad. And I'm watching that. All of a sudden, I'm not... I'm a little embarrassed. I start crying, dude. Because my dad died four years prior to that. So I, you know, you're not supposed to think about it. So like, I was shocked. That was a movie. It's stupid. So I'm sitting there. I'm crying. And you know what happened? I didn't even know I was crying until somebody put a hand in your hand. So you might put your hand there. Imagine this is me. Little hand like this to me, right? You know who was doing that? Ratatouille. Oh! Oh, shit! I didn't say it was that... I didn't say it was like a three-finger paw. You know what shocked me? You know what shocked me? There was a little boy sitting next to me and the dad's over here. He saw me crying. And he puts his hand over it. And I was terrified. Because can you imagine if the lights go on, a boy has a gang band going on? You know what I'm talking about? You've just edited eight hours of a gang band? With these hats? I don't do any... I'm not a pervert. I'm a man. I'm a pedophile. That really shocked me. So I'm trying to reconcile two things. I miss my dad. He died in really terrible circumstances. I didn't want to think about it.",
