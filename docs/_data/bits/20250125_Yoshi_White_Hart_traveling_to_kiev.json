And then five, six days ago, they told me, you're from LA? Oh my God, it's so dangerous over there. Isn't that crazy? I cannot believe LA looked like war zone and Kiev looks really nice there. But they didn't like my sense of humor there. As soon as I went out, it's a room full of Ukrainian people and I just asked like, hey, what's with all the single ladies in Kiev? They didn't think it was funny, but... You know what they laughed in Ukraine was I have to explain to them I'm not North Korean.",
