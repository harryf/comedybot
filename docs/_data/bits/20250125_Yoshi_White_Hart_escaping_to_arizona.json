I don't know if you've heard this news, about five years ago, they were test driving a driverless car in Tempe, Arizona, and there was a programming issue with the vehicle, and there was an old lady walking across the street at one in the morning. By the time the vehicle realized it was a person, it was too late. They ran over her and killed her, which, you know, is very, very sad. But you know what they say, there's always someone standing in the way of progress. Ran over this person, like, you know, Tiananmen Square. Here's the weird part, name of the vehicle, Toyota Isis. Can I ask you something? By the way, I wrote that last joke for any Muslim here tonight. Any Muslim here tonight? Okay, you know how this goes again. Anyway, I'm kidding. Please, I'm joking. If you're a secret Muslim, don't get... Anyway, I'm just joking. You know, it's a joke, you know.",
