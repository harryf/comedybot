    "text": "You know. You know how uncomfortable it is when I'm sitting waiting for the girl that I want to have sex with. I pay for her. I'm watching it and it's a movie I worked on. They're playing, you know. So I'm just like, ah. And the reason I was a little embarrassed because it was one of those movies I worked on first year and I didn't do a good job. It's kind of bad. But, you know, like I didn't edit right and I didn't check right and things like that. But it got really uncomfortable because now all of a sudden I see my friends fucking. And, you know, to you these are fantasy figures. There's fantasy to you as Spider-Man is. But these are the people I know. So I saw people and to answer your question, if you're talking about something intimate and meaningful, it was really painful because I'm watching my friend Brandon fucking. But it was the first time I saw him because he killed himself six months before that. And I didn't really want to see that scene. So, you know, this is a friend of mine I met in 1999. I've known him for a long time. And part of the reason why he killed himself is because he was living in Dublin, fell in love with a girl. But he always told me for like four years, soon as he was kind of joking to me, but soon as when I ran out of money, she's going to dump me. Well, what happened was soon as he ran out of money and no longer had a resort, he she took the kid away. So he's in another country as a Canadian, not an Irish person. On top of it, he's a pornographer. You really. He had no right. So do a lot of these people who fuck for seem for love, unless they're doing the same with their girlfriend, boyfriend or husband. Probably not. It's at the end of the day. And I think you will appreciate sex work is a work, you know, like whenever you make work out of fantasy, it's not fantasy anymore for us. You know how many times I'm sitting in the room like, please just come on your face so we could go home. All right. We have one question. You know what I mean? But. I'm. Oh, that's the. People are important. They don't have intimacy in their life. And, you know, you're doing something very intimate, but it's a physical act, you know, and. The. There is intimacy, not like having sex with love or whatever, but there's there's genuine caring before and after the show with them. And it's it's it's us against the rest of the society because they don't like pornography. As many as guys say wonderful things like it's cool to have sex with somebody as a male performer for females. Very, very tough, isn't it? Because when you get older, their process of getting marriage is difficult. Not impossible, but difficult. And when you get older and once you lose your looks and stuff, you know, it's it's it's a tough. These are people that really care for. So maybe there's no love involved.",
