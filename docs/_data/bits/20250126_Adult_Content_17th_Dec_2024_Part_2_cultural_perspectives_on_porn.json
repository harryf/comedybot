    "text": "I know you're wrong, but if your son's dying, let this chick give him a blowjob. You know what I mean? Is this wrong? It's coming from a good place. Don't let your son die like a boy, let him die like a man. Am I wrong about this? Isn't that important for guys? At 16? Hell yeah. At 16? Why did you make him laugh with that question? In America, if the parent gives permission, kids could get married. Even at a young age, providing they get permission from both parents, they could get married underage. So if you could do that, and if the kid is dying, just because we feel uncomfortable, I think it's wrong to let them die. And if that's what they really want to do before they're dead, I think it's wrong not to do that for them. It's coming from a good place. Just because we feel uncomfortable, so you should let somebody suck his dick because he might suck the cancer out of him. You know what I'm saying? Is this wrong? It's a good thing he's not here because otherwise he would be like, I have cancer. But usually also... And somebody asked me, how would you feel if your son is dying from cancer and he's gay? This is the kind of father I am. I'm going to give him the biggest, biggest, black gay cock for my son. Right? I'll stretch my son's ass wide open. But you know, fuck my son, right? Because I'm homophobic. If my son's gay and dying, then... You know, I think that's only a good father would do that. Sorry, I think about this shit every fucking day. So you're saying your son... If my shitty DNA gave my son cancer, I think that's the very least I should do. Any questions right now? Any questions? Yeah, please. This is why I'm... So you said you went to many different countries, right? Like Sweden? Afghanistan? Yeah, yeah, check this. So do you see any countries that are more open? That are generally... That they have a culture that is... This is an excellent question. And based on all the places I have been to, in my personal opinion, women who are the most confident, and they're very honest, and they're assertive, and they have a happy sex life, in my opinion, going to all those places, it's Dutch women. Because I notice most countries... Hugo is Dutch. Oh! I've never had a Dutch girlfriend. The reason why I find the Netherlands to be an amazing place, it's because most countries have one thing, but not both. So if prostitution is legal, porn is illegal. If porn is legal, prostitution is legal. Or, worst scenario, both are legal. But the Netherlands has both of those things. I'm not suggesting having porn necessarily means a good thing, but what I think it is, you have a society where you give women the freedom to make a bad decision to do porn. See, more freedom, more choices for women, is a better place. And because of the sex education in the Netherlands, that's one thing I noticed, they're very confident and assertive, you know? And I really like how parents approach sex, and like education, with a lot of pragmatism, you know? Having said that, the country that really shocked me in terms of",
