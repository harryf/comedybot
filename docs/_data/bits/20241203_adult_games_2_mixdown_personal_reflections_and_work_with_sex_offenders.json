    "text": "there's a lot of lonely people out there, and it's really hard to make a human connection, you know? And I didn't know that's what I was, I went in for money, and I ended up with no money. . But. I think when I tell these stories quite often, after the show or they email me, things that bother them. It's nice to make people laugh, but sometimes it's nice to put a smile on people's face. Alright, thank you. Round of applause for this. Thank you. Thanks for coming. I hope you enjoyed. Please come to the show. We have one question over here. Oh, okay, sorry. Okay. Hello, hello, how are you doing? Oh, good. You being Japanese, right? Japanese people being known for their respectfulness, honor to the family. I wanted to ask, how did your family take it when they knew that you were working in the adult industry? John, please. So, it's a little convoluted, but the company I work for is called Evil Angel, right? So, anytime somebody asks my mom or my family, what does your son work for? My family say he works for EA, which is a video game company, electronic art. So, everybody think I work for that company because they see this computer programming. But to answer your question, I have Japanese name, but I'm ethnically Korean. So, I grew up in neighborhood was not looked down upon, and we were not part of the society. And the area I grew up is one of the worst area in Osaka, Japan. I work kind of borderline to red line district. And my mom's not a bad person, but when you're forced to marry somebody, you just can't, you just, you know, she had mixed feeling about having kids. The women who were kind to me when I was growing up, it was always women who were sex workers in the neighborhood. I didn't know they were sex workers. I didn't know what that was, but they just happened to be people who were rejected by society. And every time I got beat up at school because I'm ethnically Korean, I didn't act like Japanese person. It was always somebody who worked with sex work or the most kindness. And then I just want to say, if you want to live in a society, and maybe you understand what I'm saying is, if you want to live in a society where they treat women really well, if you treat even sex workers well, it will trickle up to everyone because that tell me that society, they protect all women versus in society like where I grew up in Seattle in mid 90s. Somebody broke into my girlfriend's room, apartment 95, tried to rape her. Thank God she made some was not going away. And I was upset every time I was driving near her house, even when she was sleeping, I'll just drive around and make sure nobody's trying to break her off. And when you drive middle of the night Seattle area, you meet a lot of sex workers, you know, and it's a very dangerous job because in 90s, there was a guy named Gary Ridgeway, AKA Green River Murders. He was killing all the sex workers, you know. He knows that nobody cares about sex workers get away. So my feeling is you want to live in a society that is good to women, they protect every single one of them, even if you don't approve sex work. If you protect the sex worker, that tells me that your country is doing something right. I think if you protect all women, this is the good news for everyone because they have kids, you know. They are your sister, mother, aunt, grandmothers, you know. So, you know, I hope if anything, next time I hope you become a little bit more generous with sex workers, you know. Please go watch Sean Baker's Anora. There's no director in America who is more protective and wonderful with sex workers, Sean Baker. Watch all his movies, watch Anora because he's wonderful. He protects sex workers. All right, do we have more questions at this point? Anyone? All right. I don't want to take you hostage. If you want to go home, you can go home too. You said you had an incident on a scene. Like on a job where you slipped. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you take a shower before or after you finished work? I took a shower afterwards, but I was one of the last ones because everybody was in line. So, like, I was like sticky like this. I have to wait for my turn for showering, you know. But, you know. Was it right up? And did they separate? Ladies, I don't know how you deal with that smell because. I can't even imagine what kum tastes like, but it smells so bad. It sounds like a really bad Chinese restaurant in Scandinavia or Switzerland. When white people tell me Chinese food is good, I don't trust you. I'm sorry. But when I had like really bad Chinese food, kum smelled like really bad Chinese food. Really bad. Egg food, yum. Maybe these guys need to get checked out. Okay. Thanks. But that was actually a joke. Okay. This is actually kind of funny. I was really nervous during the day. Like, oh my God, they're not going to like this, you know. Can I just say, we're going to have to funny on this one, Harry. Don't poison the well. No, I'm not going to poison the well. I think, I've known this guy for what? How long now? Six months. We've been talking a lot about. Oh, wait, wait. Before you continue, last thing I want to say. These guys really took a chance because I make people mad all the time on stage. No, no, no, no, no. They get really, really, really angry. And last time I was here, I did five shows. I could only say one was okay. Other four, they were really upset. And I don't want to do that. So they really took a chance bringing me over here because I don't enjoy upsetting people. But I always do, except when I did the special show where I talk about sex work and whatnot. So these guys take a lot of credit for bringing me over here. So, thank you. Thank you. You don't have to make any money. You never make any money if you lose money. You go, Harry, and then we have one more question. Okay. By the way, if you're done for this evening, it's... If you need to go, you don't have to stay. We're over time. But the thing is, I don't know. I got to know Yoshi through Christian. And my thing in life has always been trying to understand what motivates people. And Yoshi is just a giant mystery to me of like how, why would this guy do these things through this life? Oh, I should tell you the one last thing. What is it? It's not... To me, the thing is... Thank you, man. Thank you, guys. Thank you for coming out, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. It's also like it's in the end a deeply human thing, all the things that people are motivated to do, but also that they hide through the things we do with our lives. I forgot to tell you. Also, it's extremely hard to have a conversation with Yoshi in general. He always just goes off on a random tangent. Yeah. And then you forget whatever he was saying. He's always saying that. It's taken me six months to figure out what the hell he was saying. 2012, I got fired. 2012... You did your best. I tried. 2012, I got fired from my job from Evil Angel. You could listen to this podcast, though. Last day of August, where this porn star named Augustine, she killed herself up to public shaming. It was her husband got me fired from that work. So, they covered that in that podcast. And then last of August in 2019 was top 10 podcast, because it was not by a guy named John Ronson. Many of his books has turned into movies, like Psychopath Test. He's very famous. So, last 12 years and nine months, I've been traveling the world, going to places, anything with sex-related things. So, for those of you not familiar with Jeffrey Epstein, I went to his former partner, Kelly Maxwell. I was one of the four civilians in the room when she got guilty verdict, and I was also there for the sentencing. Elizabeth Holmes, Donald Trump, SBF, Danny Masterson, Harvey Weinstein for rape cases. So, next month, I'm going to France for the rape case. Oh, that's the one I want. Like, how is it possible this guy allowed a bunch of men rape her, like 15 men one night? Is it possible for you not to feel anything next day? I'm not being sarcastic. Like, I don't want to... Do you know what I mean? I don't know. I don't know what I'm trying to say. Like, how is it possible she could not tell that she was violated for 11 years? I don't understand female physiology at that level, and I've been traveling because I think some of the most richest people on the planet, because they have a sexual problem, what they do is they fuck... That's why I think when the rich people don't have a satisfying sex life, what they do is they fuck the poor. That's what I think. That's why I go to World Economic Forum, because when I went last year... And I'll listen to what these guys are saying in Davos. Talk to all the sex workers. That's what I did, because they could tell you, because these women are fucking these guys after hours. And there's a lot of really weird people, but they're fucking mean. Not surprisingly, you know? These same people are... These people claim that they want to help the poor, but these are the same people who put the people in poor position to begin with. So, I think because sex is a difficult thing to talk to, and because these people never got healthy therapy... They did all kinds of weird sexual stuff. Not necessarily rape, but, you know, fired 10,000 people from the company. They got... They get up on it. I'm telling you, you don't have to vaginally penetrate somebody to have a sexual gratification. These guys hurt people by sexual gratification. That's why I go... There's court cases in France or New York. May 5th is David's case. I'm gonna go for sure. I went to his house. So, I think... I think... I know. I go to every one of these really weird places because as a black man in the white world, he knows that when you're a pervert, white pervert will accept you. And this kind of deviant sexual thing going on all the time. So, I'm trying to bring some light to it where... I don't mind people calling me pervert. I'd rather people talk about it. The more people talk about it, they'll start pointing patterns to deal with this problem. Because... I'm sure you probably agree to some level. I think some of the terrible things that happen in the world is because of the unhealthy sexual fantasies. Cool. All right. We have time for one more question and then we have to wrap this up. Or if you guys are short in your questions, we can do two. You're really quick? All right. You start. I'm not an expert. How was your relationship with your father? My dad died in 2003. And we don't know if it was a suicide or my stepmother killed her. So, I talked about it in Joe Rogan's podcast. To this day, I don't know. But you know what's weird? When you don't have an intimate life or growing up in like a European, like, hugging and kissing and having a loving relationship, I didn't grow up in that environment. And I noticed... If you don't have that kind of healthy intimacy, you look for something else. And Truman Capote, who wrote a famous quote, called, where family in Kansas City was murdered. He said something really interesting about... When you don't have intimacy, healthy intimacy in life, some people look for other intimacy. And very few things are more intimate than murder. And I think that's why when you look at someone like serial killers, there's a lot of sexual assault, but there's a lot of murder. Once again, going back to sex workers, a lot of the serial killers use sex workers as a service, but they start killing them because once you practice your fantasy and you reach the point where it doesn't do anything, if you want to go next level, you have to do something harsh. And they commit murder and things like that. So, I know all the things I talk is goofy, but really at the end of it, what I'm trying to... Focus is the fantasy. It could be sexual fantasy, but there's... Like Bernie Madoff ripping off a bunch of other Jews, he got up on it. Chairman Mao murdered a bunch of people. And when I read the reading when he was talking about it, you read it and you're like, holy fuck, this guy is getting off sexually by murdering people. You know, so... Cool. All right, let's wrap this up. We have one more question. You can say that for 15 minutes. I know. How does your work in Florida, your work in the history, affect your own sexual life? Or you feel like... Are you more numb? You know, because you've seen everything. Do you feel anything? Or what's about your own sexuality? Or kinks? Or does it affect you? I'll answer that other question. My parents got divorced. It was hard for me to know my dad. But I miss my dad, of course. But porn really was a factor when he was alive. To answer your question, I don't particularly... It's kind of a bad habit, but I don't like looking at porn. Not because I'm an old guy. I used to get paid to look at them. It makes me mad when I watch something, I'm not getting paid. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. If you're a boxer, you usually get paid punching somebody. I'm punching a guy in the bar, but I'm not getting paid. It's weird. But intimacy thing... Oh, so I don't really date much, you know? Because women are wonderful, but working in the porn business is kind of weird for a lot of ladies. But I was dating somebody. I met somebody after the show in January. And she got so mad at me in the middle of June. She said, I never want to see you. But I was completely honest, and I should have read between when the lady said... See, before I met her, I already bought my ticket to Europe, because I was going to meet with all my sex worker friends over here. I told her exactly what I'm going to do. I'm not going to sex with them. But I talked with them. Even though she said yes, I should have read between. She really didn't know, but I did it anyway. I'm so stupid, I just went anyway. So I even post pictures, because I wasn't doing anything like, here are the sex worker friends. I was thinking, no women want to see... their boyfriend. Hanging out with sex workers. But what I do is, I hang out with a lot of sex workers. So I particularly like talking to old men, because they have years working with men. They tell me like, sometimes I feel like, something weird happened, or this customer walking, how did you... So they'll share me with 30, 40, 50 years of wisdom, working in business. Because there's things I'm really not sure about. Because working in brothel is not one of them. But I'm so stupid, looking back like, yeah, I'm putting pictures of hookers, and mad at some pictures. But I thought she was okay, because when I'm living in Miami, there's a place called Miracle Village. And I was trying to produce a show there. And there's a bunch of people live there. It's like, it's exactly 50 miles from Jeffrey Epstein's home. Eastward, Inland Empire. And everyone that lives in Miracle Village is registered sex offenders. And I do show them. I'm like, I do comedy show for registered sex offenders, because I do one in San Luis Obispo. And the reason why I do it, because, look, what they did was wrong. And a lot of time, they got caught looking at the child nudity, or something like that. Which is bad. I'm not saying it's good. But instead of you making monster out of them, you want to know like, why are they attracted to them? You have to talk to them. Look, imagine like a cancer has a stigma, and you talk about it. Cancer is a problem. And if the stigma is preventing you from talking about it, or finding a solution for it, this is bad. So I'm trying to remove stigma by, you know, I do these shows. So I talk to registered sex offenders, East Coast and West Coast, because I want to know, why is it every time these billionaires get caught doing something bad, it always have something to do with assaulting kids? I'm still struggling with this. What is the connection for that? You know. So, but, I thought, when I told her, I'm talking to registered sex offenders, she was kind of okay. But, I made a mistake about doing that because, she really liked me, you know. But I think it was too much for her to see her boyfriend hanging out with hookers. Alright, I think this is the great statement to end on. I'm a dumb guy. I thought, no woman's going to be okay with it. I don't think, you know. That's a great closing statement. No woman wants to see her boyfriend. Yeah. She's got a lot of manners. I think she's going to get her boyfriend hung out with hookers. Thanks for the conversation. I really appreciate it because I was really worried and thanks for staying on the whole show. And if you have a question, you can contact me any time or after we go to the bar. I mean, you know. Yeah, sorry. You'll find him on Instagram. Yoshiaboyashi. Thank you so much guys. Thank you very much. You guys, you're absolutely amazing. Thank you. Give it up for yourself, please. Give it up for Ari. Give it up for Yoshi. This has been it. Whatever this was. You guys were part of everything. Thank you. I wish you all the best.",
