    "text": "because you did something fucked up in previous life, you deserve no sympathy at all. So there's less than 1% of Japanese are Christian, and these are wonderful people. They really go out there and help people. But have you noticed people with good intentions, even though they have good intentions, sometimes their solution's not perfect? I could appreciate the intention, right? Did you know every Super Bowl in America, Make Wish Foundation, they will help kids with cancer. These are like 14, 15, 16-year-olds with cancer, stage 4. They probably have six months or less to live, and they get Super Bowl tickets there. And I think this is wonderful, but I say to myself, is that the best you could do for them? You know what 14, 15, 16-year-olds with cancer, stage cancer, with raging hormone, they only have six months to live, you know what they really need? What they really need is shippers, hookers, and porn stars. I know this is not a conventional thing to do. I know English people are very polite about it, but you know what I mean? Super Bowl. You know what I'm saying. I think it's wrong to let these young men die and never to have a big delicious titty sit in their face. I think it's wrong. Right? Because, yes, don't let these guys die. Let them die like a man, right? Don't let them die like a man. You know what I mean? Like, is this your son? You know? Imagine he's 15 and he's dying from cancer. It's not his fault he has stage 4 cancer. You get him to premiere the game, this and that, but he said, Dad, you know what I really need? You know what I really need? I've got two months left. I would like to have juicy, delicious vagina, right? But he's under eight. I don't know, what's the consent age in England? 16. Okay, let's say he's 13. He wouldn't have to have a vagina. Ladies, 99% of the time, you should fuck a kid, but this is one time you should fucking fuck a kid, right? I mean, I know it sounds awful. I don't know. I'm just saying, if he's dying from cancer for sure, you know what I mean? You should at least give him a handjob or something. Right? Wouldn't you agree with me if you're dying?",
