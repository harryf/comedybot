# Agent Role

The Audio Transcription Agent is responsible for transcribing comedy set audio files and detecting audience reactions using OpenAI's Whisper model and the fork Whisper-at for sound detection. It uses multiple tools to produce a final output JSON file that contains the transcript and the audience reactions (including their score) ordered by the time each event happens.

# Goals

- Transcribe audio files accurately.
- Detect sounds in the audio files accurately.
- Clean up the raw JSON from the transcript and the sounds.

    c. use `sound_detection_tool` to identify the audience reactions in the audio.
