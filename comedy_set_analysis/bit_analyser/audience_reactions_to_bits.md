# Guidelines for Detecting Comedy Bit Structures Using Audience Reactions

Here's a structured guideline based on the analysis of the transcript and audience reactions. This should help in recognizing patterns that mark the start and end of comedy bits by analyzing audience reactions.

Guidelines for Detecting Comedy Bit Structures Using Audience Reactions
General Overview

Comedy bits typically follow a recognizable structure:

- Setup (Premise) - Engages the audience with relatable or surprising material.
- Act Out–Performs exaggerated or dramatized elements to build humor.
- More Jokes - Expands on the premise with multiple joke formats (lists, comparisons, etc.).
- Tag (Closing Punchline) - A final punchline or callback to wrap up the bit.

Audience reactions naturally align with this flow, showing patterns that indicate the progression through the bit.

## Audience Reaction Patterns and Rules

### Start of a Comedy Bit (Setup Phase)
- Pattern: Quiet Audience
-- No Laughter (Reaction Score = 0-1) during the first line(s) of a setup.
-- The audience is listening attentively, waiting for the joke to develop.

*Example:*
> "I'm not really in the mood to do comedy today because last week I went on a company retreat."
> (Reaction: 0, audience is processing the premise)

- Additional Indicator:
-- Mild Chuckles (Reaction Score = 1) may occur after a relatable or slightly amusing premise.
-- Gradual Build-up: The audience often warms up slowly

### Transition to Act Out or Punchline (Escalation Phase)
- Pattern: Increasing Laughter Intensity
-- After the setup, laughter progressively intensifies (Reaction Score = 2-3).
-- Act Outs (exaggerated mimicry, voices) correlate with sustained chuckles or snickers.

*Example:*
> "Even my toilet is disappointed. It's like: 'Dude, are we really doing this again?'"
> (Reaction: 2-3, audience reacts to the visual element)

* Reaction Delay:
-- There is often a 1-2 second gap between the act out and the audience's reaction.
-- The laughter spreads like a wave – initial chuckles (Reaction 1) grow into louder laughs (Reaction 3+).

### Peak of the Bit (Punchline Lands)
- Pattern: Highest Reaction Scores (4-5)
-- The loudest laughter occurs at the punchline or the twist.
-- Reactions may peak rapidly (sharp jump in Reaction Score).

*Example:*
> "And nothing makes you want to retreat your company like a company retreat."  
> (Reaction: 4-5, punchline delivered successfully)

- Indicators of Peak:
-- Laughter climaxes and sustains for several seconds (Reaction Score = 4-5).
-- This signals the punchline has landed well, often marking the turning point or end of the joke.

### End of a Bit (Tagging or Callback Phase)
- Pattern: Short Chuckles / Diminishing Laughter
-- Laughter fades as the comedian transitions to a new topic (Reaction Score = 1-2).
-- Tags prolong laughter briefly but don't reignite loud reactions.

*Example:*
> "It's just a quarterly review, that's all it is."   
> (Reaction: 1-2, smaller follow-up laugh)

- Audience Settles Quietly:
-- Periods of silence (Reaction Score = 0) after prolonged laughter often indicate the end of a bit.
-- The comedian pauses to let the laughter settle before introducing the next premise.

### Transition Between Bits
- Pattern: Clapping or Quiet
-- A new bit often starts after a brief silent gap (Reaction Score = 0).
-- Occasionally, audience claps (tagged as "Clapping") to acknowledge the completion of a bit.

*Example:* Start of a comedy set, host introduces comedian
> "Please give it up for your next comedian, Harry Fucks!"  
> (Audience claps, start or transition between segments)

- Awkward Silence: Sometimes, a joke falls flat. This silence may push the comedian to improvise or switch bits.

### Additional Rules for Refining Detection
- Clapping Events:
-- Often indicate segment changes, bit endings, or introductions.
-- Example: "Give it up for Kyla!" (Audience claps, marking a transition).
- Prolonged Low Reaction (0-1):
-- Indicates the comedian is either building a story or transitioning.
-- Use these lulls to identify setup phases or topic shifts.
- High Reaction Scores Cluster (4-5):
-- A cluster of high scores across consecutive timestamps is a clear indicator of a punchline and act-out combo.
- These clusters signal peak moments in a bit.

### Practical Example Breakdown

*Transcript Segment:*
> "And nothing makes you want to retreat your company like a company retreat."  
> "Who here works at a company with values?"   
> "It's always the same... we believe in diversity and inclusion..."  

*Audience Reaction:*
> (Start: 76.0, Reaction: 0) -> (81.0, Reaction: 3) -> (89.0, Reaction: 5)

- Analysis:
-- 76.0 – Setup Phase (Silent)
-- 81.0 – Act Out Phase (Moderate Laughter)
-- 89.0 – Punchline (Peak Reaction)
-- 91.0 – Tag / Callback (Smaller Laughter)

By applying these patterns, you can systematically detect the start, middle, and end of comedy bits based on audience reactions. This framework can be useful for analyzing transcripts and audience engagement, improving timing, or segmenting recorded comedy sets.
