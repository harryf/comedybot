# Comedy Bit Structure

## How to Recognise the Text Structure of Comedy Bits

Given the transcript of a standup comedy show (a comedy "set" performed by a comedian). Within a "set" there are one or more comedy "bits".

In brief, a bit has a setup, one of more punchlines, possibly an act out and will typically end in a tag. Often the setup will contain a broad statement that most people will relate to, and contain one of the words "Hard", "Scary", "Crazy", "Weird", "Stupid". This line will typically mark the beginning of a bit and the end will be the tag.

Comedy bits tend to use this structure;

## PREMISE / SETUP

The premise is where the comedian gets the audience invested in the joke - by selling the joke. They dont know the comedian and they're wondering why they're listening to the comedian. So the function of the setup is to make it something the audience can relate to

### The premise should...

- Make it Relatable: General remark which the audience can relate to and draws them in e.g. "It's hard living with teenagers"
- Typically the premise uses one of the words hard, scary, crazy, weird or stupid - these help make it relatable and give the bit a dramatic direction. Not all bits will have one of these words though but it's a common pattern.
- The premise should awake curiosity in the audience. After a generally relatable statment, it moves to being very specific to get the audience curious. e.g. "It's hard living with teenagers (general statement). Especially when the toilet is the only safe place to masturbate (very specific statement, also funny in this case but it doesn't always have to be funny).

## ACT OUT

Comedy is performance. It comes to life with drama. Pretending to have a conversation with any person or object mentioned in the setup makes the bit come to life. Acting out any person or object mentioned in the setup gives the bit colour. Following the act out, the comedian will typically give their own reaction.

An example act out might work like this with act out and reaction;

- Setup: It's hard living with teenagers. Especially when the toilet is the only safe place to masturbate
- Act-Out: Even my toilet is disappointed. It's like: 'Dude, are we really doing this again?'
- Reaction: And I'm like: 'Sorry man. But open wide!'

## MORE JOKES

Now the bit is in progress and the audience is invested. Now the comedian will typically make more jokes about the premise, "milking the bit" for more laughs. This is where comedians may use multiple joke structures such as incongruent three (rule of three), list jokes, comparison jokes, time travel, etc.

## TAG

Tags are a final joke at the end of a bit. Tags usually switch topics or "go meta" and might appear to be in response to the audiences reaction to the bit so far. For example ending our "toilet" joke above the tag might be 'Hey don't judge me! It's good for the environment. I'm saving paper'
